tafirenyikam@dailynews.co.zw MORE men than women have so far succumbed to, and been infected by the lethal coronavirus in the country, the Daily News reports.  The Ministry of Health said on Wednesday that from the close to 5 000 confirmed local cases of the disease, about 55 percent of them were males. The country has recorded 122 deaths from the pandemic.  Research suggested that smoking was contributing to more men being susceptible to the virus, as the country had more male smokers compared to females.  More worrisome, the Health ministry said, was the fact that the Covid-19 fatality rate had been rising — currently standing at 2,2 percent of infected people as of Monday.  This comes as the secretary of the Senior Hospital Doctors Association, Arron Musara, warned in an interview with the Daily News yesterday that the country’s Covid-19 local transmissions were set to rise.   This also comes as 75 new cases were recorded in the country on Wednesday, with all but one of them being local transmissions.  In the wake of the rise in local transmissions, the chief co-ordinator of the National Response to Covid-19, Agnes Mahomva, called on communities to take better care of themselves to curb the spread of Covid-19.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); The ministry’s Wednesday update also revealed that the 40 to 80 age group had the most deaths, while the 20 to 40 age group had the highest number of cases.  Meanwhile, by Wednesday Harare had the highest number of active cases with 1 737 — while 76 had recovered and 71 had died.  Bulawayo came in second with 421 active cases, 706 recoveries and 23 deaths.
