matarutseg@dailynews.co.zw FORMER Dynamos and CAPS United utility player Oscar Machapa says lack of a vibrant junior policy in the local game is the huge motivation behind the formation of his own academy in the capital. Ever since the 33-year-old hung up his boots at the end of the 2018 season, his focus is on the growth of his project named the OM Soccer Academy. The academy which operates from Harareâ€™s Blackstone Primary School, aims to provide elite coaching for the next generation of players in the hope they can reach the professional levels. However, owing to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, Machapa has been forced to stop operations at the academy for the time being. Hailing from the populous suburb of Mabvuku in the capital, Machapa fine-tuned his football skills with the now-defunct CAPS junior development structures. Blessed with a natural ability to play at right back, right wing or in central midfield, Machapa was promoted into the Makepekepe first team in 2008 and quickly established himself as a key player for the Harare giants. In 2010, Machapa left for South African side Moroka Swallows and spent three years with the Soweto club. When he returned to Zimbabwe in 2013, Machapa crossed the great divide and signed for Dynamos instead of his former club CAPS. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); The utility player went on to play for DeMbare until 2015 when he signed for Democratic Republic of Congo side AS Vita. Machapa returned to Zimbabwe in 2017 and signed for Makepekpe before finally calling time on his career.
