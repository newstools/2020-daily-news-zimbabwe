Blessings Mashaya SENIOR STAFF WRITER mashayab@dailynews.co.zw  THE MDC Alliance has slammed the government’s plans to fast-track the Cyber Bill, which will punish those deemed to have abused social media or peddled falsehoods against the State and citizens once it becomes law. This comes against the backdrop of government plans to also introduce the Patriotic Act — a law which it says would promote patriotism among Zimbabweans. Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, MDC Alliance deputy spokesperson Clifford Hlatywayo said the Cyber Bill was yet more proof of the “worsening trajectory of misplaced priorities” within the government. The MDC Alliance’s reaction comes after Justice minister Ziyambi Ziyambi revealed at the weekend that the government would fast-track the passage in Parliament of the Cyber and Patriotic bills to deal with those deemed to be delinquents. According to Clause 164 of the proposed Cyber Bill, anyone found guilty of communicating false information on the country or citizens can be jailed for five years. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); This comes as the government recently attracted withering criticism from rights groups over allegations of clamping down on critics ahead of the foiled July 31 mass demonstrations.
