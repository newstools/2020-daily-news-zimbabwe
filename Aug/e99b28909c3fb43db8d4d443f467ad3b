masakadzab@dailynews.co.zw PREACHER and author Batsirai Java, pictured, has lined-up a new book focusing on African religion and culture and relationship to Christianity. Titled African Religion, A Blessing or a Curse, the book which was published by Media Essentials will be out on Monday and it will be his third. Other books in his name are The Voice and The Mystery of Dreams and Interpretation all related to his work as a preacher. The latest offering touches on various subjects and beliefs in the African setting among them totems and belief in ancestors. He also sought to distinguish between African culture and religion which he describes as occultic.
Java said while African culture is the best, it is being ruined by several vices under the guise of religion. According to Java, the book will give an insight into a number of things existing in Africa. “This book confronts and exposes an organised demonic and regimented system that has been in existence for centuries,” he said. He also explains “misconceptions” among Africans which are disguised as culture and with Christians participating. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });  Java said the book will not only be in physical form but also on online stores for downloads.
