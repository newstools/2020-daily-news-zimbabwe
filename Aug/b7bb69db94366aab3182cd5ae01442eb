Freeman, real name Emergy Chizanga, went under the knife a couple of weeks ago after complaining of a severe headache.  “He is now fit for the stage again. Over the past few weeks, we played it low as we did not want to cause panic among his loyal fans,” Watson “Boss Watta” Kaselapanjila one of Freeman’s handlers told the Daily News.  Tonight, the Top Striker singer is expected to share the stage with Sandra Ndebele, Judgement Yard and Merciless among others on Nash TV.  “Fans should expect him in top form at the concert. He is very eager to be part of the line up,” he said.
Freeman is currently making waves in the music industry thanks to the popularity of his single Muface Wangu.  The HKD Boss, as Freeman is also affectionately known in the music industry, has shared the stage with a number of international musicians such as Morgan Heritage, Mavado, Capleton and Busy Signal among others.  Over the years, he has performed in South Africa and the United Kingdom where he has built a fairly big fan base.
Freeman has collaborated with such artistes as Winky D, Shinsoman, Alick Macheso and Jah Prayzah.
