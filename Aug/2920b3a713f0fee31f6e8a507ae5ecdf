 SUNGURA musician Peter Moyo will tomorrow throw a digital concert to celebrate his 31st birthday on Nash TV. “The actual birthday was held on August 18 but I have decided to celebrate the crucial event of my life with my fans who have collectively built the brand Peter Moyo,” Moyo said. He will be supported by Outlaw 07. Popularly known as Young Igwe in music circles, Moyo said online concerts are not as rewarding as the physical concerts they used to stage before the national lockdown. “During the weekends, especially month-ends like this, we used to stage at least two concerts per day due to high demand for our music. In the process, we used to make a lot of money and that made our lives easier as musicians. Now with this national lockdown, we are in a fix,” Moyo said.
