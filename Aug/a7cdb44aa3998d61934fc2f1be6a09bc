in BULAWAYO MDC-Alliance Bulawayo province has reacted angrily to the recall of five of its city councillors by the Thokozani Khupe camp, describing the move as naïve and anti-people. Former deputy mayor Tinashe Kambarami, who is already barred from office pending the outcome of a Supreme Court appeal on his legitimacy, Concillia Mlalazi, Alderman Ernest Rafamoyo, Tinevimbo Maphosa and Norman Hlabani were recalled from council. MDC Alliance Bulawayo spokesperson Swithern Chirowodza yesterday took a dig at Khupe, saying she was playing to the Zanu PF gallery. In a letter of dismissal to the five councillors, Khupe’s Bulawayo provincial secretary Nomvula Mguni wrote: “The Bulawayo province has decided to recall the councillors guided by the party’s constitution which states that every member shall have the duty to accept and conform to the constitution, policies, principles, rules and regulations of the party.” Khupe, who is now the acting MDC president following a Supreme Court ruling, has since recalled 21 MDC Alliance legislators and several councillors. She has also taken over the party’s headquarters, the iconic Morgan Richard Tsvangirai House, as she moves to solidify her position as the new leader of the main opposition.
