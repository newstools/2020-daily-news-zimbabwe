mashayab@dailynews.co.zw THE ongoing labour unrest in the health sector is contributing to the increase of daily Covid-19 deaths in the country as patients are not able to receive medical treatment, health experts have said. This comes as the country recorded nine Covid-19 deaths on Wednesday with the total death toll at 150 since the outbreak of the disease in the country in March. There were 5 643 confirmed cases, including 4 442 recoveries. Zimbabwe Nurses Association president Enock Dongo told the Daily News yesterday that there was a need to improve the country’s health facilities. The secretary-general of the Senior Hospital Doctors Association (SHDA), Arron Musara said the issue of Covid-19 deaths was worrisome. “We have an increase in Covid-19 deaths and it’s mainly because hospitals are not admitting people; so for those patients with comorbidities they succumb to their comorbidities or they may worsen because of Covid-19. “These people want to get medical attention to other medical conditions like hypertension, diabetes and heart diseases. This has got an impact and it is causing more deaths,” Musara said. This comes as health experts said there was a need for Zimbabweans not to relax, because the country was not yet out of danger on the Covid-19 front. Musara said the nation had to remain focused on combating the disease. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); Dongo, also warned that the country was yet to reach the virus peak. “It’s too early to say that we have flattened the curve. We are not testing much and that affects the number of cases being recorded. “We need to be cautious and follow the set guidelines, like maintaining social distancing. We are not out of danger. We are yet to get to the peak, and as such we are likely to see cases going up,” Dongo said.
