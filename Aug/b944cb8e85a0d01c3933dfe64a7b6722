 Leading Zimbabwean hospitality group Africa Albida Tourism has been selected as country ambassadors for Ride4Rangers, a global initiative to raise much- needed funds for conservation across Africa. Tourism is the key funder of conservation in Africa, but the Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating economic impact on the African travel industry which is threatening the livelihoods of millions of people as well as the future of the continent’s iconic wildlife. The fundraiser, which will see the travel industry embark on a cumulative 30 000km bike ride, is organised by charity TUSK, of which the Duke of Cambridge Prince William is patron. TUSK has secured a donor that has pledged to match funds raised up to the value of £5 million. 
The initiative, to raise vital funds to support rangers who are the first line of defence to protect endangered species, was kick-started in the United Kingdom with a Lands End to John O’Groats 15-day cycle challenge on August 15, but there will also be other local events. Funds raised are being managed by TUSK, and will be distributed across 60 different projects and conservation areas across East, Southern, Central and West Africa, with the aim being to support over 5 000 rangers and their wider families. Africa Albida Tourism (AAT) chief executive Ross Kennedy said the hospitality group was very proud to be involved with Ride4Rangers as country ambassadors for Zimbabwe, along with Zambesia Conservation Alliance. “We know that many of our trade colleagues along with our regular guests and supporters in Zimbabwe think as we do regarding conservation, and may wish to support this initiative in some way –— be it a small or large donation or act of support.” While the first local event that took place is a 65km bike ride from the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls road to Robins Camp in Hwange on August 15, more events are planned and information regarding these and how you can support this cause will be shared soon.  — LIFESTYLE WRITER
