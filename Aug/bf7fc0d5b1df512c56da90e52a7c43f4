in BULAWAYO ORGANISERS of the Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards (RBAA) yesterday postponed the event to November as the effects of Covid-19 continue to be felt in the arts sector. The awards, which had initially been pencilled for August 19 have been moved to November 28 this year.
The postponement of the ceremony also paved way for a Covid-19 rescue package for local artists courtesy of the organisers and sponsors. Speaking during a live Facebook press conference, one of the organisers Saimon Mambazo said the effects of the novel coronavirus have largely been felt in the cut throat arts fraternity. He added that the spread and impact of Covid-19 was unprecedented in such a way that the poor and the marginalised will be hard hit. Mambazo said they will also identify a further 10 vulnerable artists who are not necessarily past winners; for instance senior and elderly artists. Meanwhile, the organisers revealed that Covid-19 also forced them to cut the total number of awards categories from 50 to 32, since some of the genres were inactive. The RBAA awards were launched four years ago as part of the initiative to recognise efforts by artists from Matabeleland. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });
