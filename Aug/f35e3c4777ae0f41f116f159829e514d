 YESTERYEAR sungura singer Patrick Mkwamba is rekindling his romance with his fans after dropping two singles. Famed for his 1984 all-time hit Wapenga Nayo Bonus, the former Four Brothers vocalist has released new singles; Zuva Rekufa Kwangu and Ndoda Kuyambutswa. “I am doing this for my fans. Some might wonder where I was but the truth is that I am still in the game. In 2014, I released a single called Call Me Back before a full album Zvinonaka Zvakudhura in 2019,” Mkwamba said. The 73-year-old musician is not contemplating hanging up his guitar. “My voice will never age; whenever I am on stage or in the recording studio, I feel like I am just 16,” the Rusape based musician said.
In 2017, Mkwamba released another single Hupenyu Hwangu but the song failed to revive his waning fortunes in the showbiz. It received a lukewarm response from the market. Mukwamba became a household name in the 1980s to 1990s thanks to his chart-topping songs such as Mombe Yehumai, Vakakunda Zviedzo, Wapenga Nayo Bonus, Vambozha Vauya and Usambonyara Kusekwa (Mabhodhoro) among others. “Back in the day music was lucrative that I managed to buy a house in Chitungwiza in 1978 from royalties of one or two albums. Nowadays, one can release up to 30 music albums without anything meaningful,” the Silver Simbe front man whose artistic journey can be traced back to the late 1960s said.
