SPORTS WRITERS ZIFA’S inertia in formulating a restart plan for the local game could come back to haunt them after Confederation of African Football (Caf) yesterday announced a hectic schedule for both the 2022 Afcon and Qatar World Cup qualifiers. The Warriors are now set to resume their Afcon Group H qualifying campaign with back-to-back matches against reigning African champions Algeria between November 9 and 17. Warriors coach Zdravko Logarusic and his team will then complete their campaign with matches against Zambia and Botswana between March 20 and 31 next year. From there on, the Warriors have no time to rest as they have to compete in a tough 2022 Qatar World Cup qualifying Group G that also features Ghana, South Africa and Ethiopia between May 31 and October 12. However, what is of more concern now to Logarusic and his team is the fact that there is no football taking place in Zimbabwe at the moment due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Since March, the government has postponed all sporting activities in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. While other sporting disciplines have been allowed to resume light activities, football and other full contact codes are yet to get the green light from health authorities. A number of players in the Warriors team ply their trade in the local league and there is now a huge risk November will come by with the domestic top flight still inactive. At their board meeting held on Monday, the Zifa executive led by the under-fire Felton Kamambo failed to come up with a concrete proposal to take to government for football to be allowed to resume. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); “The schedules for the two competitions have had to be revised in light of the Covid-19 outbreak which halted many sporting activities across the continent and beyond for some time. “For Cameroon 2022, the qualifiers resume on November 9-17, 2020 with the Day 3 & 4 matches whilst the penultimate and ultimate matches take place on March 22-30, 2021. “The 40 teams in contention for the five slots for Qatar 2022 will commence the journey between May 31 and June 15, 2021 with the Day 1 & 2 matches. From August 30 till September 7, the Day 3 & 4 matches are expected to take place with Day 5 & 6 matches fixed for October 4-12, 2021.”
