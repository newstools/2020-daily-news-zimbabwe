mashayab@dailynews.co.zw INTERNATIONAL labour organisations continue to pile pressure on President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government demanding that it respects workers’ rights. This follows the recent characterisation of the country’s largest labour unions, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, by the ruling Zanu PF party as a terrorist organisation. Southern Africa Trade Union Coordination Council (SATUCC) said the Mnangagwa regime has failed to fulfil what they promised when they came into power in November 2017 and was now suppressing workers’ rights. “SATUCC, together with the international community joined the citizens of Zimbabwe to celebrate the resignation of President Robert Mugabe in November 2017 and the taking over of leadership of the country by President Emmerson Mnangagwa with the hope that the era of gross human rights violations which characterised President Robert Mugabe’s reign, had finally come to an end.

Secretary-general of the South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) Zwelinzima Vavi told the media on Tuesday that his country must take action against Mnangagwa. This comes after the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) recently wrote a letter to Mnangagwa demanding his government to denounce Zanu PF acting spokesperson Patrick Chinamasa’s statement on labour unions. In a letter dated July 29, ITUC said Mnangagwa’s government is violating workers rights. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); This follows efforts by your government and your party to disrupt a protest action against corruption in your country …
