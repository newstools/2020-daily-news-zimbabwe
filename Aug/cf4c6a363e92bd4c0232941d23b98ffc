MARABI musician Kireni Zulu is honouring music legends in the country by sponsoring videos for their yesteryear hit songs.
Zulu, who recently released coronavirus (Covid-19)-inspired songs courtesy of the General Agriculture and Plantation Workers Union of Zimbabwe, confirmed the project to the Daily News yesterday. “Legends on my list include Jonah Moyo, Mitchel Jambo and Elijah Madzikatire and, others who are late. The idea is to give their songs a fresh life,” Zulu said. The project will commence in October.
“I have partnered with videographers on this project. Back in the day, musicians were not so interested in making music videos yet their songs were so powerful in terms of lyrics and arrangement. The songs are timeless,” he said. Zulu’s project comes barely a year after seasoned Jenaguru musician Clive Malunga of Nesango fame launched his own project helping children of departed legends record. With 12 studio albums under his name, Malunga’s project targeted six musicians this year.
“I am currently recording sons of the departed musical legends and I have a target of recording at least six groups this year,” he said. This is Malunga’s second project after the one in which he erects tombstones for a number of music legends in the form of James Chimombe, Solomon Skuza, Tobias Areketa, Susan Mapfumo and Jordan Chataika among others. “We are currently working with the families of Tineyi Chikupo and Richard Mafuvamandu (leader of Nyaminyami Sounds) for the tombstones.”
