The terror gang included Musa Taj Abdul, 46, — who police alleged was a notorious criminal who had been on the run for 20 years.  Others arrested were Liberty Mupamhanga, 29; Prince Makodza, 31; Godfrey Mupamhanga, 27; Charles Lundu, 47; Rudolf Kanhanga, 29; Innocent Jairos, 32; and Tapiwa Mangoma, 27.  National police spokesperson Paul Nyathi confirmed the arrest of the alleged robbers and murderers yesterday, saying authorities had recovered an assortment of ammunition that the gangsters used in their criminal activities.   “Police recovered a silver Noringo pistol, magazine of 11 rounds, 19 x 12 bore gauge live rounds, a pair of number plates AEX1577 and a black face mask,” Nyathi said.  Nyathi added that the gang was suspected to have carried out several high profile heists at Mashwede Holdings, Glen Norah B, Blue Circle, Marlborough and Makoni Shopping Centre, among other robberies that police are investigating.  Abdul and his gang allegedly escaped arrest in March after robbing prominent Harare businessmen Tawanda Nyambirai and Rodney Dangarembizi of more than US$220 000.  They allegedly first pounced at Dangarembizi’s premises where they forcibly took away US$37 000, two vehicles and 13 cellphones — before proceeding to Nyambirai’s office where they took a safe with US$180 000.  At Makoni Shopping Centre in Chitungwiza, the gangsters allegedly fired 10 shots into the air and robbed two foreign currency dealers of US$7 000, up to $30 000 and a Toyota Allion.  The robbers, who were wearing masks, jumped off a Toyota Hilux truck armed with pistols, rifles and a machete and one of them ordered the foreign currency dealers to lie down.  On April 5, they were said to have driven to Mashwede in four vehicles, a black Toyota IST, Subaru, Toyota Mark X and Honda Fit. The gang wore masks and were armed with a gun.  They allegedly confronted two security guards who were manning the premises and threatened to shoot them if they raised the alarm.  They were said to have tied the security guards with cables, before allegedly breaking into safes and fleeing with US$99 075 and R42 000. Sponsored Links
