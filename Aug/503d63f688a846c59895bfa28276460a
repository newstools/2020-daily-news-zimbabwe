The hashtag which calls on the African Union to respond to Zimbabwean government’s violence against citizens, has since gone viral, attracting over 300 000 tweets yesterday.  Former South Africa opposition leader Mmusi Maimane was among a host of other South African personalities who took to microblogging site, Twitter, in a bid to provoke global attention on the current human rights and political situation in Zimbabwe.  Former South Africa opposition leader Mmusi Maimane “Dear @Twitter please make a graphic for this hashtag. #ZimbabweanLivesMatter. I think it deserves recognition in the same way that #BlackLivesMatter has a graphic”, Maimane said on microblogging site, Twitter.  Maimane said there has to be a way to bring global attention to the human rights abuses in Africa, notably Zimbabwe.   Multi-award-winning South African artist AKA also joined the #ZimbabweanLivesMatter hashtag: “We will do what we can as public figures and friends who can speak freely in our country for those who are scared to do so on their own, with good reason,” AKA said on his Twitter account in response to Maimane’s message.             J’Something, one of the members of renowned South African band, Micasa also posted a solidarity message by asking his Twitter followers to sign a petition asking the Zimbabwe army, police and State security to stop obeying unconstitutional orders.    Multi-award-winning South African artist Cassper Nyovest also posted the hashtag #ZimbabweanLivesMatter on his Twitter page.   How can we ever be respected if we can’t respect our own?”  Award-winning South African house musician Zakes Bantwini also joined in and also tweeted that, “With so much against us already as Black Africans all we got is each other…let’s not be against one another. Love and light to our brothers and sisters in Zimbabwe.”                   South African on-air personality, actress and model Minnie Dlamini tweeted:               South Africa-based former Warriors captain Willard Katsande tweeted, “Prayers to my brothers and sisters in Zimbabwe.”              The tweets come as there are fresh calls for broad-based dialogue as several high-profile people and other interest groups have been calling for President Emmerson Mnangagwa to end his long-drawn out feud with MDC Alliance leader Nelson Chamisa.
