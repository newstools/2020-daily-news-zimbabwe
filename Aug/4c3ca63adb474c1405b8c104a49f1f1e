SINCE the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic was reported locally, the response from the Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) has been disappointing at every turn. It began with Zifaâ€™s failure to provide a clear update on whether the 2020 season would start in March when the novel virus began spreading like wildfire across the globe. Clubs, players, coaches and fans waited for a signal from Zifa but it never came and it was only after the government declared a nationwide lockdown and banned all sporting activities that the local game got a definite picture of the way forward. If the government had remained silent, then there is a good chance local football would have remained in the dark on whether the 2020 campaign was commencing or it was waiting for the pandemic to subside. These protocols are scrutinised and vetted by their respective governments before teams can be given the green light to start training and eventually a full return to games. This has left the domestic game in limbo as there is no indication when football will finally commence.
Earlier this week, the Confederation of Africa Football (Caf) threw the cat among the pigeons when it announced that the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers will resume this coming November. The Warriors are scheduled to play reigning African champions Algeria in back-to-back qualifiers between November 9 and 17. Zifa need to act with speed and ensure local football get the government approval to return before November. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });
