mhlophes@dailynews.co.zw THE government has moved to centralise the procurement of coronavirus (Covid-19)-related materials through the National Pharmaceutical Company (Natpharm) in a bid to curb increasing corruption within its various institutions, the Daily News reports. This comes as former Health minister Obadiah Moyo was fired and arrested on allegations of corruption with relation to the procurement of Covid-19 medicines and materials. Mutsvangwa said the government was concerned over the increased number of medical personnel getting infected by Covid-19, adding that the Health ministry would soon embark on a fact finding exercise. More than 300 healthcare workers have been infected with the killer disease since the country recorded its first case in March this year. Nurses, senior and junior doctors and other healthcare workers have since gone on strike over the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), poor remuneration and unavailability of medicines in the country’s public hospitals. “In relation to the reopening of schools for end-of-year examinations, the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education has developed a school by school database to track the level of preparedness for each and every primary and secondary school in terms of compliance with Covid-19 Standard Operating Procedures that regulated the successful holding of the June 2020 mid-year examinations,” she added. Mutsvangwa further indicated that Cabinet had considered and approved a proposed Livestock Growth Plan 2020-2025 which seeks to grow the livestock sector to a US$1,9 billion economy by 2025. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); “Key strategies of the Livestock Development Plan entail the following: an animal nutrition programme; a genetics improvement programme; an animal health programme; a climate change adaptation and small stock programme; the development of market and trade infrastructure; and resource mobilization,” she said. Newly appointed Agriculture minister Anxious Masuka added that the plan would go a long way in reviving the country’s livestock, given that the country lost 220 000 cattle between January and June this year due to various disease outbreaks.
