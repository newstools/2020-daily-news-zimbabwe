Austin Karonga SPORTS WRITER karongaa@dailynews.co.zw ZIMBABWE Karate Union vice president Shihan Tawanda Mufundisi has bemoaned the eroding of discipline within the up and coming karatekas as a result of the Covid-19 induced lockdown that has rendered athletes idle. “An idle mind is the devil’s workshop, we were slowly but confidently winning the battle and idleness whereby we were taking kids from the streets into the gyms and dojos where they are taught discipline but the advent of Covid-19 has threatened to erase all the efforts,” Mufundisi told the Daily News yesterday. Mufundisi who is also in charge of full contact karate in the country said while they acknowledge their sport will be among the last disciplines to be granted green light to resume training, they have asked the authorities to allow them open some of their dojos for the benefit of athletes. Mufundisi is the only fifth dan Japan-graded Zimbabwean Shihan.
