 The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange(ZSE) has commissioned a solar plant in an effort to increase power generation in a sustainable way. The solar plant has a power generation capacity of up to 40KVA and was officially commissioned yesterday by the ZSE board chairperson, Caroline Sandura. The overall objective of the solar project was to move towards a cleaner, affordable and reliable source of power given the need to keep trading servers continuously up. Adopting the solar energy route is in line with the ZSE commitment to sustainable practices. “The ZSE has been a member of the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchange Initiative since 2015 and in 2019 it adopted sustainability disclosure requirements in its listings requirements. “In 2019 the ZSE also published principles for Green and Social Bonds to be considered by issuers intending to raise funds for green projects. “The ZSE looks forward to annual cost savings of around USD42 000 from the switch to solar energy and the payback period is within 3 years,” ZSE said in a statement.
