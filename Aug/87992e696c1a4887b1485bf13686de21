 MDC Alliance has claimed that 30 of its members have fled from their homes in fear of falling victim to the alleged on-going crackdown of opposition activists in the city. In recent weeks several politicians, activists and citizens have been arrested, with others beingsubjected to alleged torture by suspected State security agents on charges of orchestrating the 31 July protest. MDC Alliance provincial spokesperson Swithern Chirowodza told the Daily News on Sunday yesterday that they feared for their members’ safety. Chirowodza, whose home was also recently raided, said the party was now planning on the way forward. He said for those who had fled since the crackdown begun, no one had returned home yet.
Takunda Madzana, one of the activists who was allegedly abducted, tortured and dumped in a bush, said he no longer felt safe. This comes at a time Matabeleland Forum, a grouping of civic society here, on Wednesday issued a statement indicating its concern “on the harassment of human rights defenders and journalists….” The Forum further implored President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government to immediately release all citizens arrested for exercising their right to demonstrate. The Forum also appealed to the Southern African Development Community, the African Union and the United Nations to put in place urgent diplomatic interventions to avert the current alleged human rights abuses in the country. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });
