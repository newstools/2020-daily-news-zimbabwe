 ZIMDANCEHALL chanter Tawanda Mumanyi aka Seh Calaz has announced his divorce to wife Moira Knight through social media. Moira is the daughter of former ZBC broadcaster Eric Knight. The Mumota Murikubvira hit-maker made the decision after he was publicly exposed by his wife on social media for allegedly being irresponsible.   He apologised to his fans for the divorce. “For the time being, I am asking for my private space away from the media, friends and relatives. I am not the first person to experience divorce and definitely I am not going to be the last. As someone with kids I cannot publicly say everything. To all my fans, friends and family who feel like I have let them down I humbly apologise, I am sorry. I am human too,” Seh Calaz said.
