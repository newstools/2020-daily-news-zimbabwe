karongaa@dailynews.co.zw THE late bodybuilding administrator Munyaradzi Musarurwa has been described as a pillar of the sport and will be solely missed following his untimely death earlier this week. Musarurwa, who was popular in the fitness circles, passed away on Sunday morning after he was involved in a car crash in Harare and was buried at Glenforest Cemetery on Wednesday afternoon. National Federation of Zimbabwe Bodybuilding and Fitness (NFZBBF) secretary-general Quiet Shangai said the late bodybuilder, who also dabbled in acting and was known as Cde Jackson, will be sadly missed. “It was a difficult moment as bodybuilders bade farewell to Munya; that’s when reality really sunk in that Jackson is gone,” Shangai told the Daily News. “The fitness and strength-related activities industry will never be the same again. Hopefully senior bodybuilders like Eddie Fresh and Bla Bruce will continue to bind us together. “We need a lot of strength because Jackson had three sides that I knew him for, a brother, a bodybuilder and a businessman/farmer. “To some of us who share the same childhood suburb (Glen View) with him, he was a mentor and inspiration. I personally knew Jackson that many might not know. He was a motivator from academics to business because he went through that.” Musarurwa’s nephew and family spokesperson Tongayi Marufu said the family had lost a huge pillar that will be difficult to replace.
