 BULAWAYO City Council (BCC) has resolved to decommission KSB pumps at its water works after it emerged that they posed a great risk to the quality and water security of the city.
This comes as the local authority came under the spotlight after residents accused it of being responsible for water-borne diseases which resulted in 13 people dying while over a thousand were affected. In its latest council report, concern was raised over one of the pumps pumping untreated water to raw water at the Criterion Works. “As a result it was proposed to fully decommission the two raw water KSB pumping stations at Ncema and Fernhill for a period between eight to 10 weeks. “The director of Engineering Services (Simela Dube) reported that KSB pumps stationed at Ncema and Fernhill pump stations pumped untreated water into the raw water reservoir at Criterion water treatment works. “In addition to the KSB pumps, there were Sulzer pumps that also conveyed untreated water into the raw water reservoir at Criterion water treatment works. “Currently, the Sulzer pump stations were operating with two pumps at each station and without stand-by pumps. These stations were also in relatively bad condition. “This current situation at all raw water pumping stations posed a great risk on the water security of the city especially with the current drought condition and decommissioning of almost half the supply dams,” read the report in part. This also comes at a time council has been dragged to court over the killer diarrhoea outbreak in the city.
The report added: “The current unfortunate water scarcity and lack of raw water that was to be pumped by the KSBs strongly encourages and supported the decision of removing the  working pumps so that the contract would be completed and commissioned before the coming  rainy season in October 2020.”
