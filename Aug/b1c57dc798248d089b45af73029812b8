AFTER making waves on social media over his controversial stage attire, gospel musician Sabastian Magacha says critics should brace for more outfits of a similar nature from him, the Daily News on Sunday reports. Last week, the Ridza Bhosvo hit maker staged an online concert dubbed Many Mouths courtesy of Adam Molai Foundation, an organisation he is the brand ambassador to, while clad in controversial attire that sparked debate among music enthusiasts.    His critics interpreted the attire as rooted in the dark world. He said creativity is his portion, not controversy. The controversial stage attire was designed by Jasper Mandizera. Magacha said Christianity does not limit people to formal attire.  Magacha’s song Mweya Mutsvene, featuring Jah Prayzah,  is one of his more popular songs with over three million hits on Youtube. It was released two years ago. Magacha is not new to controversy. In the past, he made headlines after divorcing his wife while some inappropriate pictures of his recently went viral. Some of the songs that made Magacha a household name include Gwenzi, 1+1 (Back to Sender), Tinoparidza Chete, NdiJeso Anosimudza and Tomudana, among others.
