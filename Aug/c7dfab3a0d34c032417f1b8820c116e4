 ZIMBABWE should approach the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Russia with extreme caution as it is yet to pass all the necessary clinical trial stages, a top virologist has warned.  This comes after Russia announced that it had found a Covid-19 vaccine which has since been tried on humans.   For the vaccine to be medically approved, it has to undergo four phases, according to Manasa.   The last phase involves monitoring in use. The virologist revealed that on a national level, a number of Covid-19 cure research proposals have been submitted to the government and they were waiting for funding to develop them. “Ours will be focusing more on the natural herbs, but it is only that research is expensive to carry out,” he said.
