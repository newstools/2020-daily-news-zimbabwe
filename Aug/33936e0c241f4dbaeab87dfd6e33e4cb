chayav@dailynews.co.zw MUSICIAN Tahle Wedzinza will today launch her debut studio album online titled Rushesha .  The songstress said in coming up with Rushesha which consists of six songs, she was inspired by her life experiences.   Tahle made headlines in the media for being the only female artist under the now-defunct Jah Prayzah’s Military Touch Movement stable.  Songs on the album are: Go, Goosebumps, Hande, Ndomirira, Dai Ndanga and My Love. “The song Go talks of freedom from a toxic love; I love the song as I demonstrated my mbira playing skills. Goosebumps is a love song about the romance of courtship, the song talks of how a woman feels when she is treated right,” she said. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });   The songbird collaborated with Trust Samende, the lead guitarist of Mokoomba on the song Ndomirira.  “Ndomirira is a gospel track. It speaks about the need to depend and wait on God because there are situations where there is absolutely nothing you can do to change the status quo except to wait on God,” Tahle said.
Tahle’s collaboration with Jah Prayzah titled Give Me More has more than 2 million hits on Youtube.   The 20-year-old diva commenced her commercial career of music at the age of 18.
Prior to this, Tahle achieved a phenomenal track record at the National Eisteddfod.  In her high school years at Gateway High School, she walked away with 14 national honours awards and eight national trophies, against an average of 1 000 entries.   “We can share our languages with the entire world and bring so much unity at home by showing how languages can beautifully live together in song. So our culture inspires my music.  “I want to help change the narrative of the African story. I want the world to see us as comfortable in both our own skin and in our own hair,” she said.
