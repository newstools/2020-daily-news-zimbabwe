CONTROVERSIAL Zimdancehall chanter Saul Mutsaka aka Soul Jah Love says the house he recently built will not be demolished by authorities as it has all the documentation. The singer posted video images of the house on social media. This comes barely four years after another house he was building in Budiriro near High Glen Shopping centre in Harare was demolished by the local authorities as it was considered an illegal structure. “This time they are not going to demolish it. It has all the papers,” Jah Love said in the video while carrying building materials into the house. However, it is still to be established where the newly built house is located as efforts to get in touch with the chanter were in vain. The news of the Ndini Uya Uya hit maker’s house comes after another Zimdancehall chanter Killer T posted his finished dwellings on social media. Killer T’s house is believed to be in the affluent suburb of Aspindale Park near Marimba Park in the capital. Other Zimdancehall musicians who have managed to build houses include Winky D in Zimre Park and Freeman in Glendale, Harare.
