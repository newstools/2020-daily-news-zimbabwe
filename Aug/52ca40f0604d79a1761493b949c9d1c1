INFORMATION Communication Technology (ICT) minister Jenfan Muswere says the government is committed to providing equitable access to digital technologies to all citizens, including those in rural areas.  Speaking through his deputy Dingumuzi Phuthi at the commissioning of a communication information centre (CIC) in Hwange yesterday, Muswere said:   He said while the job market was shrinking, opportunities were opening up for those in the technology industry, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, machine learning and block chain.  “Like I said last week, in Mashava, (Masvingo) knowledge in ICTs is replacing low quality and low income jobs with better quality and more rewarding jobs. I, therefore, repeat my call for our youths to take up studies in ICTs so that they can occupy their rightful place in the emerging fourth industrial revolution,” Muswere said.  He urged the Hwange community to develop Internet-based content written in their own languages and dialects. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });   Speaking at the same event through his deputy Alfred Marisa, Potraz director-general Gift Machengete urged farmers to take advantage of CICs being set up by the government across the country to market and sell their products.  Machengete said government had established 146 CICs across the country’s 10 provinces, 114 of which were already fully functional.   “Therefore, through the utilisation of CICs, community members can circumvent the negative effects of Covid–19 and continue living their normal lives,” Machengete said.  He said CICs created employment opportunities for several youths in various communities.  Potraz together with the ICT ministry have embarked on various projects that support the penetration rate of ICTs across the country.
