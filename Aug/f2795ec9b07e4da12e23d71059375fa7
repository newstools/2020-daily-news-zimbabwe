 GOSPEL singer Munyaradzi Charamba-Nyakudya has resurfaced with new singles to be released next week. Charamba-Nyakudya is dropping the new singles ahead of her forthcoming album, which is yet to get a title. Charamba-Nyakudya, who is sister to legendary Fishers of Men front man Charles Charamba, embarked on her solo career in 2017. She was a backing vocalists in her brother’s group until she broke out with the album Testimony that same year. “I thank you all for your support. I am nothing without your support and I always want those that support me to know that they are appreciated.” The initial plan was for the upcoming album to be dropped this year but Nyakudya-Charamba shelved the release to a later date due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak. Of late, the Charamba family has been churning out more solo acts to solidify the legacy that has already been set by Charles and his wife Olivia. The couple’s daughters Shalom and Eternity launched their debut singles titled Mbiri Yose and Tonamata, respectively, last month.
