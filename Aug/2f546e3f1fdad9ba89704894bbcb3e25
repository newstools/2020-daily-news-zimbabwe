chayav@dailynews.co.zw VETERAN actor, author and poet David Mungoshi, pictured, died on Saturday night after battling a kidney ailment. He was 71. David was a cousin of the late legendary bilingual writer Charles Mungoshi.
Charles’ son, Farayi, confirmed the sad news to the Daily News yesterday. The National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (Nacz) described the late Mungoshi as a multi-talented individual who excelled in various disciplines. Moyo said Mungoshi left a huge gap in the arts sector. “A former University of Zimbabwe linguistics lecturer, Mungoshi will also be remembered as an actor for his role as John Huni in the local ground breaking soapie Studio 263. He also starred in other local film productions, The postman and Ngugi wa Mirii’ Secrets which he also assisted in editing. Author Stanley Mushava described the late Mungoshi as a great spirit.“We were nominated together in the Nama fiction category…usually dominated by novels. What made sharing a table with Mungoshi special is that this is the man whose Moto magazine columns under the pen name Chigango Musandireve had made realise me femme fatales femme fatales femme fatales I could be a creative writer 14 years earlier. He was always eager to share his vast knowledge and never one to look down on a younger writer — in fact he often repeated his philosophy around that.”  Poet Mbizo Chirasha described Mungoshi as a giant in the arts. “Rest in peace legendary writer Mungoshi; sad to hear the news of your sudden death.” Mungoshi’s works include The Fading Sun, Stains on the Wall, Broken Dream and Other Stories and Live Like an Artist.
