 UNITED States-based artist and lecturer Tanyaradzwa Tawengwa has won the National Sawdust gong. The award-winning artist is the granddaughter of the late George Tawengwa, the founder of legendary Mushandirapamwe Hotel in the capital. “I am happy to share that I was recently selected as one of the National Sawdust winners for their Digital Discovery Festival New Works Commission. Composing is important to me because my father taught me; ‘the tales of the hunt will always glorify the hunter until the lioness begins to write’,” she said. National Sawdust is meant to build new audiences for classical and new music by providing outstanding resources and programmatic support to both emerging and established artists and composers. National Sawdust is both a state-of-the-art performance venue and a recording studio housed within a preserved century-old sawdust factory. Tawengwa is the founder of Nhanha Incorporated, a company dedicated to creating children’s edutainment materials in Zimbabwean languages. Last year, she produced an album in honour of the iconic Mushandirapamwe Hotel. In 2018, she attracted international attention after coming second in the University of Kentucky-hosted Alltech Vocal Scholarship Competition which featured 21 contestants from all over the world.
