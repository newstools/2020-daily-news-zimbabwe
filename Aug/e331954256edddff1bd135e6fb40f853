nekatit@dailynews.co.zw RISING Afro-fusion musician Lovemore “Lovezh” Nerudzo, pictured, is optimistic that his new video Elengina off his 2019 offering Mwari Mupenyu (God is Alive) will breathe life into his fledgling career. Nerudzo hopes the video will push the album far as it has already been received well on the market. The video comes barely a week after the 35-year-old Brave Stars Band leader released his latest studio album Giant Wanyanya that is currently receiving fair airplay on local radio stations. The video was produced by Blessing Muchenga at 263 Studio Lab in Harare. “Elengina’s video was produced on public demand. We timeously released it yesterday to complement our latest album Giant Wanyanya which is already doing fine on the market. It was tailor-made to make our fans dance and enjoy our beat,” Nerudzo said. “We encourage our fans to like and follow our social media pages including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Your feedback helps us to improve our brand by enhancing our music’s appeal,” said Benhilda Antonio the Brave Stars’ media and publicity liaisons officer. Nerudzo is equally happy with the response on Giant Wanyanya, a 10-track project that comprises the potential hit I Want to Marry You which is trending on social media and has since triggered a dancing competition on Facebook. Other songs on the album are Giant Wanyanya (title track), I Want To Marry You, Dzidzanai featuring Somandhla “Mafia” Ndebele, Vandinotemba Naye, Mkoma Gidza, Ndiphembeleleni, Simba Mukaka featuring Mark Ngwazi, Vanodanana, Kusaziva Kufa and Usatsamwe. His discography is made up of Farai Nesu (2017), Chikuru Kufema (2018), Wenyama Ngaafare (2019), Mwari Mupenyu (2019) and Giant Wanyanya (2020).
