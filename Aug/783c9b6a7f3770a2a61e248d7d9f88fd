 Mono Mukundu We live in a country that is a dream killer when it comes to the arts. The real moment of truth comes when one falls sick or finances really goes down south and you can’t afford the basics. In such cases I think calling out for help on social media or conventional media should be the very last option; the reason being that when an artist becomes a charity case it really does serious damage to their brand and to recover from such a situation is a struggle. So even though our income is very low as artists, we must try as much as possible to save money & avoid buying luxuries we do not need. In the developed world, record labels will loan new artists money to clothe themselves well, buy a good car and sometimes change where they live so as to up their image. If they look like zvirikufaya it is good for their brands, it is attractive to the fans rather than being a beggar artist who asks for a cigarette or drink from fans at his own gig. So protect your brand, don’t become a charity case. This is Mono, God’s favorite guitarist signing off. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });
