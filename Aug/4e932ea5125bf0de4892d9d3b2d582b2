ZIMBABWEAN crooner Garry Mapanzure who is riding high off the success of his recently released Sushi Season EP and Wapunza has linked up with Soko Matemai on the song We Party All Night. This is the sixth single release from the Pungwe Sessions Vol. II. The bouncy Afro-Caribbean-styled song sees Mapanzure doing what is now synonymous with his brand as he melodiously declares his love for a woman and their future. Soko Matemai continues to impress and display his versatility on this song as he delivers a smooth verse to compliment the song’s tone. In 2014, Point Black and its African Hip-Hop Blog brand partnered with Rymez on a collaborative project called Pungwe Sessions. The goal was to showcase Zimbabwe’s best hip-hop talent by leveraging the African hip-hop blog’s and Rymez’ collective reach and relationships to maximise exposure. The first single titled Phil Chiyangwa by Jnr Brown held the top spot on the ZiFM Urban Chart for 10 weeks. 
Three more singles were released from the EP. All four singles on the Pungwe Sessions charted on various radio stations in Zimbabwe. They have been playlisted on various radio stations in Zimbabwe, South Africa, Zambia, Namibia, Australia and, The USA as well as playlisting on two seasons of the Big Brother Africa reality show. The artistes involved with the project were able to draw direct economic benefits from on the project via publishing royalties and performance bookings. With Pungwe Sessions Vol. II which is supported in partnership with Goethe Institut and the Zimbabwean German Society, Point Black and Rymez are looking to follow up on the success of the first project and create more impact for the artists involved.  Pungwe Sessions Vol. II is a collaborative album that hopes to elevate Zimbabwean musicians via education, collaboration and promotion. Sponsored Links
