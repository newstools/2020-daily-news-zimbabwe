IT IS now very clear to all those who choose to see, that no matter what long-suffering Zimbabweans try to do to lift themselves out of their decades-old misery, they are on a hiding to nothing as long as the narrow interests of politicians hold sway.  In fact, and to be brutally frank, Zimbabwe’s long-standing political and economic crises have richly benefitted the country’s career politicians in both Zanu PF and the MDC — which is why they all do their damnedest to maintain the current toxic political deadlock.   For example, the stability-inducing government of national unity (GNU) of 2009 was fought fiercely by both Zanu PF and the MDC, resulting in its premature dissolution in 2013 — and before then, the disgraceful abuse by both parties of the leaders of South Africa who midwifed the much-needed deal.  Currently, all rational calls for national dialogue have also been frustrated by both Zanu PF and the MDC, whose leaders speak in tongues on the subject, being only interested in talks that guarantee their positions at the feeding trough.   Readers of the Daily News will have noticed that for some time now we have been trying to focus the nation’s attention on things that really matter for ordinary Zimbabweans — so that we all don’t continue to be side-tracked by the histrionics of our career politicians and their supporters. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });
