 ZIMBABWE on Friday recorded 14 coronavirus (Covid-19) deaths, bringing the total to 67, the ministry of Health and Child Care said in an update.  This comes at a time when the number of recoveries is going up. The country on Friday had 1 004 recoveries, after an increase of 80 — 65 in the Midlands province, 10 in Mashonaland West, three in Matabeleland North and two in Bulawayo.  “Today (Friday) we report 14 deaths which occurred from 26-31 July 2020 in the community and on admission to casualty departments at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals and other hospitals after investigations and post-mortems were done.”  Since the onset of the Covid-19 outbreak on March 20, the total number of confirmed cases as of Friday was 3 169, recovered 1 004, active cases 2 098 and 67 deaths.  The country has since declared an indefinite national lockdown is a bid to contain and mitigate the spread of the killer pandemic that has wrecked economies, killed tens of thousands and infected millions of people across the world.  Zimbabwe’s fight against the disease is hampered by a myriad of problems, among them lack of equipment, personal protective equipment and strikes by healthcare workers, including doctors and nurses. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });  President Emmerson Mnangagwa has since appealed to healthcare workers to abandon industrial action and help in fighting Covid-19, warning the nation will perish if they continue with the strike.  Mnangagwa was speaking at the burial of the late Agriculture minister Perrance Shiri who also succumbed to the pandemic on Wednesday.  Doctors and nurses are yet to respond to Mnangagwa’s plea.
