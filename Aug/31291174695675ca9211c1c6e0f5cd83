in BULAWAYOZIMBABWEAN immigrants have once again been given a reprieve after the South African government extended the expiry date of their visas to October.  Thousands of Zimbabweans in that country were facing deportation following the expiry of their visas after travel restrictions induced by the Covid-19 lockdown were imposed.  However, many had been trickling back home as life in that country became unbearable under lockdown conditions.
South Africa’s Home Affairs minister Aaron Motsoaledi announced the new development yesterday in a notice in line with the National State of Disaster Regulations.  “The directions extend the initial validity period from 31 July 2020 to 31 October 2020. This means that lawfully issued visas which expired from 15 February and during the period of the lockdown are deemed to be valid until the end of October 2020,” read the notice in part.  Zimbabweans and other foreign nationals who overstay in South Africa are now banned from entering that country for a period ranging from one year to five years. An estimated three million Zimbabweans are living in the neighbouring country after they fled their motherland in search of greener pastures.  However, the outbreak of Covid-19 has made life difficult for the refugees, who mostly survive on menial jobs in the neighbouring country.  Currently, those returning from South Africa have been contributing the largest number of Covid-19 infections in Zimbabwe.
