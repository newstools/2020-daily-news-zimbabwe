British Airways pilots have voted to accept a deal that will temporarily cut pay by 20% and eliminate 270 jobs, says the pilots’ union Balpa. The deal prevents a controversial “fire and rehire” scheme where staff would have been handed new contracts “on worse conditions”. The 20% pay cuts will reduce to 8% over two years and to zero in the long term. The ballot result saw 85% of members accept the deal on an 87% turnout. BA had proposed to make 12,000 staff redundant, as it struggles with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, with 1,255 pilot jobs at stake. Balpa said there would still be some compulsory redundancies, estimated at 270 jobs, although that number is “likely to fall” as BA will be working with the union to mitigate the impact of the changes. On 28 July, trade union Unite threatened industrial action against the airline “with immediate effect” over plans to hand staff their notice and then rehire them on new contracts with unfavourable terms. Talks with other BA staff, such as cabin crew, engineers and office staff, are still continuing. The plunge in travel will drive airline losses of more than $84bn (£66bn) this year, the International Air Transport Association has warned. It said last month that 2020 revenues would drop to $419bn, down 50% from 2019. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); BA has insisted that it is doing its best to save jobs. On Thursday, Willie Walsh, the boss of BA owner IAG told the BBC that the coronavirus crisis was the worst the company has faced in its history. IAG reported a loss of €4.2bn (£3.8bn) for the first half of the year, and Mr Walsh said it would take until at least 2023 for passenger levels to recover. – bbc.com
