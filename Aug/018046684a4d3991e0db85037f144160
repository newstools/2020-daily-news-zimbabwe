JUST last week, some teacher organisations called for the start of serious consultations on the modalities that should be followed in reopening schools. This made a lot of sense, especially the fact that it was an obvious acknowledgement of the important place learners’ futures occupy on the list of national priorities. Public examinations, have traditionally determined the direction a learner’s life would take. As such, it remains an important process in the whole education programme for leaners at all levels. Assuming that whatever followed like online learning, zoom lessons, radio lessons as well as other ad hoc programmes, would address the needs of learners adequately preparing them for this year’s examinations is far-fetched. There are learners who never had an opportunity to be part of any of these channels, not because they did not want to, but because of their parents’ and guardians’ station in life. How the respective nations will respond to these calamities facing them is dependent on their unique situations. In Zimbabwe, the 2020 learning calendar should just be written off. If anything, this is the time that stakeholders must be sharing ideas on how best the challenges in the education sector in the context of Covid-19 can be addressed.
