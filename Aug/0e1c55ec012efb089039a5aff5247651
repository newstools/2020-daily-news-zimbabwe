DUB poet Desire Moyo has challenged local established musicians to use their work to interrogate the prevailing social, economic and political situation in the country. Moyo, who calls himself Moyoxide, said artistes should use the power of music to challenge the ruling elite. In a new poem, Moyo takes the challenge in particular to Jah Prayzah, Winky D, Sandra Ndebele, Jeys Marabini, Clement Magwaza, Alick Macheso, Madlela Sikhobokhobo and Sulumani Chimbetu. He added that while artistes are normally in pursuit of fame and gold, that will be fallacy and fantasy when compared to people’s lives and good governance. In the poem Moyo questions why corruption arrests on trumped up charges of activists, abductions, and torture are being ignored by musicians. “I am a social commentary practitioner and I am missing the voices of established artists in the arts. I see them as pilots of the national discourse and national narrative but they are nowhere to be seen.” He further noted: “In our differences and diversity in the creative and cultural industries we can collectively call for calm and peace in Zimbabwe.”
