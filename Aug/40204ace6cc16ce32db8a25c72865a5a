machakairet@dailynews.co.zw THE government is set to construct four customs inland dry ports to reduce corruption and ease clearance at borders. This comes amid allegations of graft and delays at most of the country’s ports of entry, prejudicing the government of millions of dollars in hard currency through custom and import duty evasion. According to the latest Government Gazette, the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) intended to recruit four architectural consulting firms to develop dry ports in Makuti, Mutare, Masvingo and Bulawayo. Zimra has now invited local and international registered architectural firms with proven records of accomplishment, qualification and experience to submit their expressions of interest for the designing, construction and supervision of the inland dry ports. The consultants have been required to submit company profiles, registration documents, curriculum vitae of key personnel and professional staff among other requirements. In a recent report by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Defence on the status of the country’s border posts, it was revealed that the country’s border posts were so porous that 16 187 people were arrested between January and June 2019 for illegal crossing. The statistics presented to the committee in March this year, showed that out of a total of 186 immigration officials implicated in corruption, 177 were convicted and only nine were acquitted.
