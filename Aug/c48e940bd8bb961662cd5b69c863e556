 Churches in Zimbabwe will now be able to post their services on online platforms, with their followers able to watch for free, on Sasai Watch.  A Sasai insider said until the COVID-19 lockdown is removed, churches in Zimbabwe and their followers will be able to upload their services and show them every Sunday on Sasai Watch without paying for the data.  A special promotion has been introduced in Zimbabwe to assist churches and their followers to access services during the lockdown although the platform is available in every African country. The free data only applies on Sundays and can also be used to watch anything else on the Internet, including some social media platforms for free.   Churches can use the service by getting in touch with the Cassava Smartech team in Harare. This development comes as a digital solution to the Zimbabwean online users as they will be able toÂ  watch church services from the comfort of their homes whilst also practising social distancing in these COVID-19 times.
