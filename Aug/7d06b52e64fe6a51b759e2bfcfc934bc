THE foreign currency auction system has arguably brought price and exchange rate stability. Is this a myth or reality? This article seeks to discuss the dynamics of the auction system that was introduced by the central bank in June of 2020 to replace the interbank market exchange rate system. From the onset, one has to ask the following questions: Who was driving parallel market rates? Why did the interbank market fail? Is the auction system sustainable? The major players now participating in the auction system are the same players who were yesterday allegedly sourcing forex from the black market to finance raw materials imports and other foreign payments. With the introduction of the auction system, the official rate rose from 1:57 to 1:83 as at August 23. In my view, it is just the official rate that has caught up with the parallel market rate. The premium still exists. For example as at August 23, the parallel market rate was 1:120 compared to the official rate of 1:83, which means that the auction rate is a moving target. It will never catch up or be at par with the parallel market for the following reasons: googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); Importers will supplement what they get at the auction from the parallel market in order to meet their full import requirements. The diaspora remittances are around US$150 million per month. This is money getting directly into peoples’ pockets. This money is liquidated on the parallel market Part payments to gold producers and tobacco farmers are liquidated on the black market. Civil servants salaries and wages are offloaded at the parallel market. Embassy and NGOs staff receive their salaries in USD and they are likely to offload on the parallel market. The market has dollarised (and not de-dollarised as we are made to believe). Hence the use of the USD for transactions is now the order of the day. It is because of the above reasons that the gap between the two rates will remain unabridged. The only way to kill the black market is to fully dollarise and decommission the RTGS/bond note, which is not going to happen because of the pressures from employment costs of civil servants. The elephant(s) in the living room are:  lack of forex supply response and a mono-currency that is worthless. Unless these two mischiefs are addressed, the auction system will remain a price discovery mirage. The mono-currency is a surrogate currency. By December 2020, I hazard to forecast that the auction rate will breach the 1:100 mark. I hope I will be proved wrong.    Sponsored Links
