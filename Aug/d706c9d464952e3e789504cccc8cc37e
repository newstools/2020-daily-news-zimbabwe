chayav@dailynews.co.zwONE Voice Concert’s season five will be held online in line with the national coronavirus (Covid-19) lockdown regulations, organisers have said.  The event is held each year around September and October and strives to unite church choirs from different denominations.   According to Tavengwa, the forthcoming event is going to be bigger compared to the previous editions.  “Internet knows no national borders and this will make our event big as more people will watch the event from different countries in the world,” he said.  Regular performers at the event include the United Family International Church Choir, Heartfelt Worship Team, Africa Praise and Zaoga UCCI Choir among others.  Meanwhile Spirit Praise will launch the One Voice Concert Season 4 DVD on September 1.
It will be a virtual launch as well.  The government put in place a national Covid-19 lockdown in March to curb the spread of the deadly pathogen in the country.  As part of the measures of the lockdown, people were ordered to stay at home, minimise unnecessary movements and avoid crowding. Only exempted workers were allowed to remain working during the course of the national lockdown period.  Owing to uncertainties created by the pandemic, most of the events in the country have been held online and these include high profile concerts like Alick Macheso’s 52nd birthday bash and Simon Chimbetu Commemorations.
