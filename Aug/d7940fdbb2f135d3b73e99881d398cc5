 Blessings Mashaya SENIOR STAFF WRITER mashayab@dailynews.co.zw  THE coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic has seriously affected the second session of the 9th Parliament which will soon come to an end. This comes as both the National Assembly and the Senate are not sitting as the country is grappling with the spread of the deadly Covid-19. Legal watchdog Veritas said 25 Bills that were on the Legislative Agenda are still to be passed despite government’s assurances to both its citizens and the international community wanting to invest in Zimbabwe that the full implementation of the Constitution will be expedited. According to Veritas some of the outstanding Bills include Labour Court Bill, Magistrates Court Amendment Bill, Police Bill, Insurance and Pensions Commission Amendment Bill, Securities and Exchange Commission Bill, Deposit Protection Corporation Amendment Bill, Competition Amendment Bill, Petroleum Amendment Bill, Medical Aid Societies Bill, Persons with Disabilities Bill, Private Voluntary Organisations Bill, Prisons and Correctional Service Bill. Those bills before the National Assembly include the Constitution of Zimbabwe Amendment Bill (Number 2), Forest Amendment Bill, National Prosecuting Authority Amendment Bill, Zimbabwe Media Commission Bill, Attorney-General’s Office Amendment Bill and Financial Adjustments Bill.
