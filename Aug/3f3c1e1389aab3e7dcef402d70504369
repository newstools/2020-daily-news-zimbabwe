 Government has gazetted the Zimbabwe Manpower Planning and Development Amendment Bill which removes Higher Education minister as the responsible authority to manage the Zimbabwe Manpower Development Fund (ZimDef) and replaces him with a board. This comes after the ZimDef allegedly lost about US$245 000 to former Higher Education minister Jonathan Moyo who claimed he channelled the funds towards Zanu PF’s activities. The Amendment Bill, which was approved by Cabinet early this year, also seeks to make the Act consistent with the constitutional provisions dealing with gender balance, transparency and accountability in financial matters and accountability of all institutions and agencies of government to Parliament. The Amendment Bill further indicates that the ZimDef shall be used to develop skilled manpower and professions and support the creation of new knowledge, research, innovation, science, technological and engineering solutions and business enterprises. The Bill also provides for the transfer of persons employed in tertiary institutions from the Public Service to the Tertiary Education Service Council established by the Bill. The gazette further indicated that the Council’s function will also be to encourage dialogue between the government, and the institutions of technical or vocational institutions and teacher’s colleges and to implement government policy on any matter relating to tertiary education.
