chayav@dailynews.co.zw DENDERA musician Suluman Chimbetu has penned an open letter to his late father Simon ‘Chopper’ Chimbetu revealing how he misses him. This comes as the Chimbetu family has lined up Chopper Virtual commemorations on August 15.  “This weekend completes a whole 15 years since you left this earth. We still miss you as family and so do many of your allies and legion of fans. One of your close friends reached out to me with a photo of you, the late mdhara Brian and him in the streets of Harare. The virtual concert to commemorate the late musical giant will see the Chimbetus in the form of Suluman, Allan, Tryson, Saiwe and Douglas sharing the stage on Ngoda TV on social media. The Chimbetus will be supported by other musicians such as Kurai Makore, Ammi Jamanda and Obert Chari, among others. Chimbetu died in 2005 at the age of 50. “This year is actually going to be bigger and better as we are going to celebrate also the lives of other dendera music legends in the form of Naison and Briam. It is going to be a three in one event,” Allan, one of the organisers, told this publication in a previous interview. Makore is a cousin of United States of America-based Chimurenga musician Thomas Mapfumo. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });  Recently, Suluman supported Makore in honouring Mukanya, as Mapfumo is fondly known as in the music industry, on his birthday bash that was also held on Ngoda Tv.
