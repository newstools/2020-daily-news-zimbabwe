 MBIRA musician-cum-herbalist Diana Samkange says she is doing brisk business selling traditional herbs following the global outbreak of the deadly coronavirus (Covid-19). This comes as more Zimbabweans are using traditional herbs such as Zumbani and a host of others to fight the pandemic. Popularly known as Mangwenya, Samkange, apart from gathering natural medicines from the bushes or forests, also grows herbs for commercial purposes at her farm. Despite the high demand for her services and products, Mangwenya never advertises in the media. “I help a lot of people in society with the majority of them being the elite. The satisfied clients refer their friends and relatives to me and that’s how the business has grown over the years,” she said.
