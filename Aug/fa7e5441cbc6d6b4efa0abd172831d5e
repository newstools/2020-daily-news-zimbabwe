 HIT film Neria has inspired musician Godfrey “Solution” Chirau to pen a song Mukoma Edmore which talks about property rights. The video of the song was uploaded on Youtube last month and it features comedian Anna “Chibaby” Honde. Released in 1993, the film Neria talks of a Zimbabwean widow Neria (Jesesi Mungoshi) who falls prey to her greedy brother-in-law Phineas (Dominic Kanaventi) who takes her children and belongings. The film also features the late music superstar Oliver Mtukudzi as Jethro. The 1 hour 43 minutes long film was directed by the late Godwin Mawuru and the story was done by award-winning author Tsitsi Dangarembga. The film Neria was a star- studded one. Mawuru was an influential cog in the defunct soapie Studio 263 while Mtukudzi was a musician par excellence. He was the first musician to be declared a national hero all because of his rich music. He left behind 66 studio albums. He died at the age of 66. Dangarembga is an award-winning novelist, playwright and filmmaker.
Her debut novel is Nervous Conditions and it was the first book to be written in English by a black Zimbabwean woman and it was named by the BBC in 2018 as one of the top 100 books that have shaped the world. Dangarembga’s book This Mournable Body which talks of the obstacles facing women in Zimbabwe, has recently made it into the Top 13 of the Booker Prize. On the other hand, Mungoshi, the widow of the internationally- acclaimed author Charles Mungoshi, joined the acting industry in 1985 when she featured in the ZBC play Inongova Njake Njake, a play taken from her husband’s novel with the same title. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });  She went on to feature in a number of successful films and dramas such as African Journey, The Journey, He Is My Child, Rujeko, Shaina, Cook Off, Muzita Rababa and in commercials adverts among others.
