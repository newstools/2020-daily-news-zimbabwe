Vasco Chaya GOSPEL musician Argatha Murudzwa-Ndembera is working on a singles’ collection album to be released before end of year. The move is meant to give fresh life to her music. However, the Press On hit maker is going to improve on some of the songs. Murudzwa-Ndembera is determined to launch the Hits Collection despite the Covid-19 national lockdown regulations which forbid gatherings. Currently, Murudzwa-Ndembera is in the studio putting some final touches to her forthcoming single. “The single is going to be my last this year. It is going to be a huge surprise to my fans as I have collaborated with one of the best musicians in local music,” she said. Murudzwa-Ndembera recently collaborated with sungura musician Panganayi Hare on a song titled Uri Wangu.
Hare’s song which tackles the issue of moving forward after setbacks in relationships is off his forthcoming album Pfimbi Yegudo.  Some of her studio albums include Fambai Neni, Ndimi Mwari, Ngatitye Mwari, Upenyu Hwangu, Mwari Anotiona, Press On, No Pain No Gain, Grace Period and Breakthrough.
