 ZIMBABWE Karate Union (ZKU) vice president Shihan Tawanda Mufundisi is worried about the lack of discipline among up and coming karatekas, especially during the current coronavirus (Covid-19) lockdown. Since March, the government has declared a nationwide lockdown while a 6pm to 6am curfew was introduced last month in a bid to curb the spread of the novel virus. Mufundisi, who is also in charge of full contact karate at ZKU, acknowledged their sport will be among the last to get government approval to resume but asked for a relaxation so they could begin light training at their dojos. “We are committed to observing the Covid-19 guidelines once we are allowed to resume training, we don’t want to be fighting against what we can prevent now. “It is our hope that our wish will be granted and allow the sport of karate to flourish in the country,” Mufundisi said.
