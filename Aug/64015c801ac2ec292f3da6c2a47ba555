 SPORTS WRITER Bafana Bafana star Percy Tau has been handed Warriors captain Knowledge Musona’s former squad number at Belgian side Anderlecht. Tau completed a season-long loan move to the record 34-time Belgian champions last Wednesday, extending his stay in the country to a third consecutive season following previous loans at Union Saint-Gilloise and Club Brugge.   Anderlecht have since updated their website to reveal that the 26-year-old will wear the club’s famous No. 11 shirt in the upcoming campaign — a jersey that was previously worn by former Kaizer Chiefs star Musona. Tau donned his new number for the first time during a training match against Lommel SK on Monday. Musona wore the strip during the first half of the 2018/19 season before joining Lokeren on loan, and the Zimbabwe international is currently enjoying another spell away from the club with fellow Belgian side KAS Eupen. Meanwhile, the Warriors skipper played the entire 90 minutes in Eupen’s opening game of the season on Sunday against OH Leuven which ended in a 1-1 draw at the Den Dreef Stadion. Sascha Kotysch gave Leuven the lead after 57 minutes before Ghanaian Isaac Nuhu equalised for Eupen 18 minutes from full time. From the first whistle, Musona and his teammates dominated the game as they had the home team on the back foot. Eupen were asking all the questions in the opening half especially with Nuhu and Konan N’Dri on the flanks while Musona was deployed in a more central role. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); Despite their dominance, Eupen were let down by their lack of precision in front of goal and they were duly punished after the break. Kotysch gave the home side the lead while Eupen levelled with a team goal involving Musona, captain Nils Schouterden and substitute Julien Ngoy.   – Additional reporting Kick Off
