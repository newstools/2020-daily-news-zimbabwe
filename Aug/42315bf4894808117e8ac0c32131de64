tafirenyikam@dailynews.co.zw SENIOR medical specialists at the country’s main referral hospital, Parirenyatwa, downed tools yesterday to self-isolate at home citing coronavirus (Covid-19) fears, further worsening public health service delivery, the Daily News reports. This comes at a time when nurses have been on strike for over two months, while senior doctors followed suit last month demanding salaries in United States dollars and provision of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE). In a letter to the hospital’s medical superintendent last week, senior resident medical officers (SRMOs), who include obstetricians and gynaecologists, said their decision to withdraw labour with immediate effect came after a significant number of health workers on the frontline tested positive for coronavirus. The doctors said they had chosen to self-isolate at their homes “in the best interest of other health care workers whilst Mbuya Nehanda Maternity Hospital is being disinfected”. Last month, the government announced that 323 health workers had contracted Covid-19 since the beginning of the outbreak in March. Addressing the media, chief co-ordinator for the national response to the Covid-19 pandemic in the Office of the President and Cabinet, Agnes Mahomva, expressed concern over the development although she said the figure was still within manageable levels. “Every time we have a healthcare worker infected, it is of great concern to us, so we continue to prioritise them at all times by procuring more PPE,” Mahomva said.
