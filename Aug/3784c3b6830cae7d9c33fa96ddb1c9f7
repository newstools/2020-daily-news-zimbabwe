Vasco Chaya LIFESTYLE WRITER chayav@dailynews.co.zw  PREPARATIONS for the premiere of a film — Rufaro — for the deaf community are at an advanced stage, Miss Deaf Pride Zimbabwe, the producers have revealed. The new film will go a long way in entertaining and educating the deaf community pertaining to issues of sexual health and rights among others. The deaf community is doing a lot to promote its members. In June, former Miss Deaf Photogenic Africa winner Kuda Mapeture designed a unique face mask for the deaf community. She made the mask out of a transparent (clear) material which covers the mouth and then surrounded by the fabric.
