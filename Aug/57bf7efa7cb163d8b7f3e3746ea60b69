LIFESTYLE WRITER VICTORY Siyabonga Theatre has been busy recording video skits as an awareness tool for peace-building as well as the Covid-19 global pandemic and this courtesy of Nhimbe Trust’s Bluez Cafe who offered them working space. Director Desire Moyo said: “We appreciate the help at this time of need, this time of lockdown, this time of global pandemic.  We have managed to come out of our homes to meet up and have a space where we operate from. This helps us to then put our heads together and try to assist the nation towards fighting Covid-19 using our creative ways, and also our innovative initiatives to fully combat this Covid-19 by raising awareness through recorded jingles of poetry, music and drama. Victory Siyabonga Theatre has so far done commissioned works for some of its partners and have also done rehearsals for video skits that they have been recording around the city. He said for rehearsals they observe all the preventative measures as subscribed by the WHO. “We all have personal masks and the organisation has also worked on branded masks from Victory Siyanqoba for the members when we go out for shows and when we do our performances in terms of recording them. “So we have made sure that we have sanitizers, offered to us by Nhimbe Trust during our rehearsals as well as for our office work.  So in terms of Covid-19 we are very much aware and cautious of our safety, it comes first.”
