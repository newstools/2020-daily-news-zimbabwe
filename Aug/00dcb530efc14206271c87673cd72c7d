 JAH Prayzah Junior, pictured, son of the multi-award-winning musician Jah Prayzah is working on his debut musical project set for release anytime this year. He will be releasing a single which will be launched on Nash TV. “Mukudzeyi Junior is in the studio creating magic. While he is set to launch his first single, he has a number of songs mostly taken from his father’s list of unrecorded songs. ‘‘He took the songs and reworked them to suit his age and style,” Jah Prayzah Junior’s manager Simbilimbi told the Daily News yesterday. Jah Prayzah Junior is aged 10 and doing Grade 4. “He is pursuing Zimdancehall mainly with a bit of his father’s Afro-fusion genre. He is eager to carve his own path which is different from his father. His father will be there to guide and give him support and direction he needs in the music industry.” Last year, Jah Prayzah Junior starred in his father’s musical video called Dangerous and the project has more than a million views on Youtube. His father was equally excited to see him following in his footsteps. Most of the modernised parents, especially those who have artistic minds are encouraging their children to take up arts as a profession.
