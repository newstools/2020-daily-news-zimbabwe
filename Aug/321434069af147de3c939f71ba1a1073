Masystem Acho features an old lady, Mai Dingos (Gonyeti) who stages one-woman demonstrations in the community against the rampant building of houses on open spaces.  She always questions  the authorities and demands accountability.  Mai Dingos goes on to partner with a local journalist Linda (Magi) who is also interested in covering human interest stories but she is facing a challenge from her editor who is not interested in stories to do with corruption and service delivery among other issues.
