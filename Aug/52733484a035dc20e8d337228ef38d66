 ARTS promotion company Team Big Family has launched a lockdown photo competition called Face of Lockdown where four winners will walk away with US$200. The contest is open to people aged 17 and above and, will run until August 23. The top four winners will be given US$50 each said. The initiative comes after the government put in place the coronavirus national lockdown in March as a measure to curb the deadly virus from spreading, barring all social gatherings such as physical musical concerts and weddings. As a result, most of the arts and social events are now being held digitally in line with the regulations of the Covid-19 national lockdown. Some of the events held online include concerts, pageants and exhibitions among others.
