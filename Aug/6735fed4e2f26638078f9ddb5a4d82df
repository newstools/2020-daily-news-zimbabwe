  ACTING Mpilo chief executive officer Solwayo Ngwenya has challenged people to take the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic seriously as the worst is yet to come.
Solwayo has since March consistently used the micro blogging platforms Twitter and Facebook to warn the masses on the dangers of the deadly pandemic. In an interview with the Daily News yesterday, Ngwenya boldly declared that the future in the fight against the pandemic was gloomy in view of the ignorance and recklessness exhibited by citizens. “My motivation is to save lives which I have been doing for decades on a smaller scale, but now I have gone global.
“Historically, my late father survived the 1918 influenza pandemic and he told me about the devastating effects of that pandemic so this has stuck to me throughout my life,” Ngwenya said. “Seeing and sensing the impending catastrophe with a population so relaxed and cynical and a healthcare system that will not cope with the figures, I have taken this forceful stance.
“Some will listen, some will not. Many will die, some will survive to tell the story.” Ngwenya said in four months 4 075 cases and 80 deaths have been reported yet when he launched his warning campaign on March 19, there was no single reported case in the country. The Mpilo hospital boss, who was recently awarded a professorship, said if nothing decisive was done there would be mass deaths and mass graves in Zimbabwe as the pandemic wreaks havoc. “The virus will be devastating to the people here as there is so much ignorance and myths, among other things. And in the ensuing chaos, there will be mass deaths. “Going forward, very soon you will see huge numbers of cases unless something drastic is done. There will be many tears shed.
“The hospitals will be overflowing. The mortuaries will be full. The grave diggers will not cope,” Ngwenya said.
In his advice to all the stakeholders, Ngwenya said: “Without urgent decisive, but unpopular action we are doomed.”
