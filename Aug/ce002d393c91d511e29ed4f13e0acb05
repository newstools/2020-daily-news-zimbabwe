karongaa@dailynews.co.zw PROMISING Zimbabwe triathlete Andie Kuipers is thrilled after securing a scholarship to further her studies and continue her development at the Lenoir-Rhyne University in North Carolina, United States. Kuipers, who left Harare at the weekend, will be pursuing an Exercise Science degree at the institution while also taking part in competitions. The 17-year-old represented Zimbabwe at last year’s World Championships in Lausanne, Switzerland and finished in position 59 out of 70 contestants during her maiden international event. Triathlon Zimbabwe (TZ) coach Pam Fulton said Kuipers’ departure for the US was a combination of sorrow and joy. TZ spokesperson Carol Pakenham concurred with Fulton that Kuipers’ departure aroused mixed emotions. “It is very sad that we do not have the same facilities here at home that could offer aspiring athletes like yourself to train and race at elite level. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); Former TZ coach Wayne Davidson said he was confident Kuipers will do well in the US and develop into an international triathlete. “Andie has competed in triathlon since 2015 and has represented Zimbabwe at all levels including the World Championships; maybe her finest achievement was a podium finish at the All Africa Games,” he said.
“I for one have confidence you will achieve your dream of qualifying for the Olympic Games — see you there.”
