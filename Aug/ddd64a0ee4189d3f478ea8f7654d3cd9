chayav@dailynews.co.zw LOCAL musicians have embarked on an online petition calling on government to enact a 90 percent local content policy on all radio stations. Zimbabwe Musicians Union (Zimu) chairperson Edith WeUtonga said such a development will enhance creativity among the artists, give Zimbabwe a sense of pride in national culture and languages and increase listenership base for the musician. This will also create employment through the music value chain among other benefits. WeUtonga said the 75 percent local content policy introduced by self-exiled former minister of Information Jonathan Moyo through the Broadcasting Services Act of 2000 yielded desired results then. When Moyo introduced the 75 percent local content policy around 2000, it resulted in the popularity of urban grooves music in the country.
