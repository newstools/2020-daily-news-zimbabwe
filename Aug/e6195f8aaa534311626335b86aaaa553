 Mugove Tafirenyika and Blessings Mashaya SENIOR STAFF WRITERSTHE African Union Commission (AUC) is following closely political developments in Zimbabwe and has warned the government against flouting its human rights charter.    He encouraged Mnangagwa’s government to uphold the rule of law, allowing media freedom, freedom of assembly, freedom of association and right to information.  This comes at a time when AU chairperson  and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa had dispatched special envoys to Harare to find ways of assisting the country.  The envoys, former South Africa vice president Baleka Mbete; ex-ministers Sydney Mufamadi and Ngoako Ramatlhodi; and Pretoria’s ex-ambassador to Ethiopia, Ndumiso Ntshinga, met Mnangagwa.  It also comes as South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) said the party believed there were serious political problems in Zimbabwe warranting the regional power house’s intervention.  Leader of the opposition Congress Party in Botswana’s Parliament, Dumelang Saleshando, called on President Mokgweetsi Masisi to publicly condemn the alleged violations in Zimbabwe.
