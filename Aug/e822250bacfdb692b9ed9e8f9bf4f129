karongaa@dailynews.co.zw TRIATHLON Zimbabwe (TZ) are on schedule to commence their 2020-2021 season despite the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic after staging an incident-free duathlon event at Donnybrooke Course at the weekend. Since March all sporting events have been banned by the government as a measure of trying to curb the spread of the novel virus. However, triathlon and other low risk or non-contact sporting disciplines were allowed to partially resume but must adhere to strict health guidelines. TZ secretary-general Carol Pakenham commended athletes, parents and all stakeholders present for adhering to the Covid-19 regulations as they build up to the season resumption. “Thank you all for your cooperation in abiding by the new rules we have had to put in place i.e. strictly online registration, wearing of masks, social distancing, hand sanitising, limited spectators etc. Without your compliance we will not be permitted to have any events so well done everyone and thank you. Pakenham also paid homage towards the support of their first duathlon event. “Thank you to everyone who came and supported our first duathlon of the 2020-2021 season, a tester and training event in the run up to the resumption of our 2020-2021 season in September,” she added. “It was wonderful to see you all again, and welcome to the new members of the triathlon family. A huge thank you to Jim Perry for allowing us to use the venue — to Legend Sport for sponsoring the hire of the venue — we really appreciate this generous gesture.” Sponsored Links
