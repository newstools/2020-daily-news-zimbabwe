SINCE the coronavirus outbreak and resultant national lockdown in March, health and government officials have been all out in the provinces educating the masses on the virus and how to mitigate it. At most of these gatherings, especially in rural communities, the majority of those in attendance would be the elderly. And instead of speaking to these elderly people in the language that they understand our officials always prefer to speak in English. But marginalised people have a right to clear, accurate, and accessible information about the disease and response efforts. They need information in a language and format they understand. It must also be presented in a way that is relevant to them, and available in a channel they can access and trust. We urge government and Health ministry officials to translate information on Covid-19 into all the 16 local languages because the spread of the pandemic and the measures to tackle it challenge monolingual ideologies. The availability of knowledge in the languages of the people not only ensures that the message is not misunderstood due to a poor level of command of the official language but also creates trust, which increases the likelihood of acceptance.
