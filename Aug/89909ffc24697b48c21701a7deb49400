ACTOR Munyaradzi Musarurwa known as Comrade Jackson died in a car crash along Airport Road in the capital on Sunday. He was 57. Musarurwa, who was also into bodybuilding, was described as a unifier in society.“He was a unifier in the family and the entire society at large. His departure is a huge blow to the family and both the arts and sports fraternities,” family spokesperson Tongai Musarurwa told the Daily News yesterday. Musarurwa featured in local dramas such as Cobra and in music videos including Mukwasha by Jah Prayzah which has more than three million hits on Youtube. Jackson also worked at the Zimbabwe National Amateur Bodybuilding and Weightlifting Association and at the Tendayi Chaipa-led Harare Bodybuilding and Fitness Association as its secretary-general. “The National Federation of Zimbabwe Bodybuilding and Fitness’ entire community is in shock. To some of us, Musarurwa was more than a gym colleague. “He was a brother. We got a lot of inspiration from him. Apparently, we were raised in the same hood although he was obviously older. We share the same high school. I am not able to believe the jovial giant is gone. “Today is really bad for the industry,’’ National Federation of Zimbabwe Body Building and Fitness secretary general Quite Shangai said. Mourners are gathered at number 1 Masocha Ndlovu in Hatfield, Harare. Burial arrangements will be announced in due course.
He is survived by his wife Alice and three children.
