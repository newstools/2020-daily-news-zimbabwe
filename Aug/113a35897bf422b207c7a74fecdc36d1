VICE PRESIDENT and also Health minister Constantino Chiwenga on Tuesday tabled in Cabinet an ambitious restructuring strategy to transform public health delivery service which has been comatose for a considerable time. Chiwenga said among his top priorities would be ensuring an end to the perennial industrial action by doctors, nurses and other health workers over remuneration and conditions of service, which include lack of personal protective equipment and critical shortages of drugs. The strategy, he said, would be anchored on four pillars that include the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, ventilators, hospital beds and other essential equipment. Chiwenga’s strategy is highly ambitious considering the state of the public health delivery system currently obtaining. Our system has almost completely collapsed. It needs a complete overhaul, a serious renewal. Chiwenga must approach Treasury and seek a supplementary budget in the short term to ensure doctors and nurses are back at work, basic equipment is in health facilities and that drugs are available as we fight the lethal coronavirus. “Maybe the government has not yet revealed its entire plan, but focusing on biomedical engineering and manufacturing hospital beds and ventilators does not solve the immediate problems bedevilling our health sector,” SHDA secretary-general, Aaron Musara, said. We agree with Musara, let us have first things first!
