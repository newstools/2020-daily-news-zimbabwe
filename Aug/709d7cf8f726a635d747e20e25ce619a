AMMARA Brown has just dropped a video for the song Glow In the Dark directed by Blaqs with cinematography credited to Joe Njagu. It was produced by Ammara and Thomas Brickhill. Released last week, the video seemed to have been overshadowed by the global #ZimbabweanLivesMatter campaign. The singer was literally attacked on social media when she tried to promote it amid the powerful social media campaign and owing to public pressure, she instead joined the movement. However, after all has been said and done, Ammara urged struggling Zimbabweans to “glow” despite experiencing the darkest hour in their journey. Over the years, Ammara, who ventured into music at a tender age has collaborated with a number of both local and international musicians. Some of these include the late South African music superstar Hugh “Bra Hugh” Masekela on a track titled Next Lifetime, Nigerian star Mr Eazi on Svoto, Jah Prayzah on the track Kure Kure, Tytan on Mukoko and Bhachura with EXQ, among others. In 2015, the late South African jazz guru Masekela praised Ammara, tipping her to be the next African superstar. He urged her to maintain her artistic standards as she has the potential to be the next biggest thing on the international market.
