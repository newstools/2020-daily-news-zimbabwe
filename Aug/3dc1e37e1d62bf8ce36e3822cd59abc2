karongaa@dailynews.co.zw ZIMBABWE Cricket (ZC) has called off the incoming tour by Afghanistan after failing to get the nod from the government following a sharp increase in the cases of coronavirus (Covid-19). This comes as the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) recently wrote to all national associations outlining additional health measures and guidelines to combat the spread of the novel virus. Afghanistan were scheduled to arrive in the country on July 27 for the limited overs series but that will no longer be happening due to the increase in cases. As of yesterday, 84 people had lost their lives from the confirmed 4 339 cases since Zimbabwe recorded its first case in March. “You are therefore reminded to always adhere to the set rules, guidelines and procedures for the prevention and containment of Covid-19 in the sport and recreation sector. Any laxity shall not be tolerated.” As a result of this announcement from the SRC, ZC had no choice but to cancel the Afghanistan tour.
