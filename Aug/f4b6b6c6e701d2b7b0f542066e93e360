 CONTROVERSIAL Zimdancehall chanter Soul Jah Love has interceded for his fellow musician Seh Calaz who recently divorced wife Moira Knight on social media.
This comes after Knight exposed Calaz as an irresponsible father on social media. “I have experienced what Calaz is currently going through. It is a tough time. Ladies are easy targets of the devil. But God help us by restoring our marriages. We do not want to be single,” Soul Jah Love prayed in Shona in a video that has gone viral on social media. During the divorce period, Moira exposed Calaz, posting tattered sofas on social media making the Mabhanditi leader a laughing stock in some sections of the society for the fake lifestyle he leads. “Bounty Lisa has never posted secrets on social media to expose me but I am praying that Satan should leave Calaz’s life. Satan do not try to cause troubles in Seh Calaz’s marriage as you have done in my life,” Jah Love said. A couple of years ago, Jah Love divorced his wife Bounty Lisa. Calaz has pleaded with society and media for his space for the time being saying he was not the first person to experience divorce and definitely not the last. He reportedly bought a car (VW Beetle) for one of his loyal friends recently, proving a point that having torn sofas is a choice as he has the money.
