machakairet@dailynews.co.zw TOP flight club CAPS United have been dragged to court by LED Travel and Tours (Pvt) Ltd (Led) over an outstanding US$11 000 debt for air tickets issued on credit in 2017. In summons filed in the High Court, Led wants payment of US$10 835, 23 or the equivalent in local currency at the prevailing auction rate on the date of payment with interest at the prescribed rate. According to the court record, on February 14, Led claimed US$11 286, 70 at the Harare Civil Court being the outstanding amount for international airline tickets purchased on behalf of Makepekepe and $2 390 for car hire services offered between March and June 2017. The court heard on May 5, 2017, the parties made a verbal agreement for Led to provide air tickets for travelling of its team players for an away African Champions League and was now owing US$11 286, 70. CAPS was supposed to settle the debt within 30 days after which Led wrote a letter of demand on November 6, 2017 and all efforts to settle the issue seemed futile leading to issuance of summons at the civil court. The court process took long as CAPS were now denying owing Led any money until June 4 this year when they decided to make a payment of $13 676, 70. However, the amount was disputed because it was not equal to the amount that was being claimed by the travel agency since the first claim of US$11 286, 70 was to be paid in foreign currency or in local currency at the prevailing bank rate. On July 8, the parties were scheduled to appear before the magistratesâ€™ court for pre-trial conference but CAPS were in default and this forced Led to file a notice of withdrawal and instituted their claim before the High Court. Led is arguing that the $13 676, 70 paid by CAPS offset the $2 390 which was due for car hiring services and the balance of $11 286, 70 was calculated to be equivalent to US$451, 47 at the authorised interbank rate when the payment was made.
