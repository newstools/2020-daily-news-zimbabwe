mhlophes@dailynews.co.zw THE Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has so far arrested 8 051 machete-wielding gang members who have resurfaced and are terrorising mining communities, the Daily News reports.  The machete gangs infamously known as the MaShurugwi went on a rampage last year as they robbed and attacked mining communities across the country.  National police spokesperson Paul Nyathi told the Daily News that the police were running a national operation Chikorokoza Ngachipere in a bid to purge the machete wielders from mining communities.   “The Jumbo mining area in Mazowe had the most arrests followed by other arrests in Bindura, Manicaland, Midlands in Gokwe and Shurugwi and Matabeleland South in Gwanda, Maphisa and Matopo.  “Currently there are areas that we are monitoring, but for now I cannot reveal the exact locations because the individuals being monitored might be alerted. What I can assure you is that we are ready to strike any minute from now,” Nyathi said.  The Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association (Zela) recently revealed in its latest situation report that the machete gangs had resurfaced, as many jobs and sources of income have been disrupted by the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic prompting many to move into the artisanal mining sector for quick money.  “A series of machete violence cases have been reported in June and July 2020. In Zvishavane, one man was injured following a gold rush. In Matobo at Nugget Mine a machete gang violence case was reported. Reports of the gang invasions were also recorded in Maphisa, Makwe, and Mvana with criminals and gold gangs escaping with cash, digital scales, and gold ore. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });
