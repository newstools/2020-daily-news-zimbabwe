 Vasco Chaya LIFESTYLE WRITER chayav@dailynews.co.zw  RISING Zimdancehall star  Jah Master hopes he can maintain the current trajectory his career is enjoying and hopes it will soon propel him into the top echelons of the local music industry. This comes as Master is enjoying a huge buzz with his latest offering titled HelloMwari which has since garnered over one million views on YouTube. The song was premiered just over two weeks ago on NashTv and is already enjoying massive air play and support from radio and DJs. The 23-year-old, whose real name is Rodney Mashandure, has high hopes for the future as it seems most of the genre’s lovers are gravitating towards his songs. At the moment, the three big acts in local music are Alick Macheso, Jah Prayzah and Winky D leaving a lot of work for Jah Master and other singers to break into that group. After noticing the success HelloMwari has generated, NashTv hopes Master will keep his feet on the ground and work on his craft so that he can create even more hit songs.
