karongaa@dailynews.co.zw International Karate Organisation (IKO) Nakamura Zimbabwe’s branch chief Shihan Tawanda Mufundisi and his family have partnered with an orphanage in Kambuzuma in a bid to help the children. With most of the under-privileged children from the Kambuzuma District Office unable to pay the joining and monthly subscription fees required at most dojos, the Mufundisis are now training the orphans pro-bono. The project is being spearheaded by Mufundisi’s 15-year-old son Sempai Jean-Claude, who holds a first Dan black belt, while his siblings Alicia and Ashwin will also help out. As a result, Mufundisi has already formally requested the partnership with the Kambuzuma District Office.
