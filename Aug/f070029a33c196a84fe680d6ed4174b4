machakairet@dailynews.co.zw MUSICIAN Felistas Murata popularly known as Mai Titi is challenging a $500 000 defamation claim raised against her by businesswoman Memory Muyaka after calling her a prostitute, witch and gossiper during Facebook broadcasts. Murata entered her notice of appearance to defend the suit in the High Court through her lawyers Machiridza Commercial Law Chambers but is yet to file the full details of her opposition. Muyaka who is a director and shareholder of Khloe’s Home and Décor (Pvt) Ltd wants the $500 000 and interest at the prescribed rate to the date of full payment if the order is granted. According to court records between November 17 last year and April 3 Murata who has over 270 000 followers on Facebook published several broadcasts on the platform and on Whatsapp about Muyaka whom she also calls Mai Khloe or Mai Maketeni. The court heard Murata labelled Muyaka a prostitute, witch, gossiper and accused her of blackmailing her clients. The two were friends before they began accusing each other of jealousy prompting Murata to take her rage against Muyaka to Facebook. Murata is claimed to have said Muyaka belonged to a society called illuminati that is believed to be involved in Satanism.
She then accused Muyaka of attempting to kill her through illuminati. “This was false and intended to impute that the plaintiff is an evil person. This statement is wrongful and defamatory of the plaintiff who is a Christian.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });
