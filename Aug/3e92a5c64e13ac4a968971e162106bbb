Mugadza, who had a history of hypertension, died on Saturday at his Harare home shortly before he was taken to hospital. 
Initially, the Harare businessman was scheduled to have been buried today but his younger brother Godfrey, yesterday said there has been a change of plans at the request of his children, who are based in Canada and Australia. “We have since moved the burial to the weekend, the reason being that his children abroad requested to be present at his burial,” Godfrey told the Daily News yesterday. Mugadza’s death came at a time when the family is going through a difficult time following the passing on of his brother Freddy “Pasuwa” in Atlanta, United States in April 10. Due to the travel restrictions brought about by the coronavirus (Covid-19), the family is battling to repatriate Freddy’s remains.
Dynamos prominent fan Chris “Romario” Musekiwa was devastated by Mugadza’s death at the weekend. “We are gutted and can’t believe it. Surely we are living on borrowed time. Mugadza gone too soon at a time he was making frantic efforts to repatriate Chairman’s body .May His Dearest Soul Rest in peace,” Musekiwa said.
