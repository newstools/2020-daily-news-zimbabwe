mashayab@dailynews.co.zw ZIMBABWE launched the first virtual communication and collaboration platform called Glue virtual platform (Glue VP) developed by Africans in the country. The platform is a brainchild of Zimbabwe-born professor, Richard Chinomona. “The Glue VP combines the functionality of major virtual platforms. It provides high quality and affordable access for users with real-time support and security. “Communication on the platform is fitted and secured with an end-to-end encryption to protect users from third party infiltration.” Chinomona is hoping that the Glue VP would be a solution to the urgent needs of African learners to access education at their own time and wherever they might be. Speaking at the launch, Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (Potraz) director-general Gift Machengete said the platform will go a long way in helping people as the country is struggling to deal with coronavirus. “Indeed this latest platform that we are launching here today deserves recognition because for a long time, Africa has had to rely on virtual collaboration and communication platforms developed outside the African continent such as Zoom, Skype, Microsoft Team, Google Meet and Cisco Webex among others. “Distinguished guests, such self-sustaining home-grown solutions as the phenomenal innovation whose launch we are here to witness, could not have come at a much better time as the country and the world at large is grappling with the deadly Covid–19 pandemic. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); “This pandemic has changed our way of life by teleporting us all from the physical space to the virtual space. This has created a ‘New Normal’, where virtual meetings have replaced our good old-fashioned face-to-face meetings,” Machengete said.
