matarutseg@dailynews.co.zw HIS wish was to probably play another season and give a fitting goodbye to his beloved club CAPS United and their multitudes of fans at the end of the campaign. However, because of the coronavirus (Covid-19) that has affected the sporting world, veteran CAPS United defender and captain Method Mwanjale might not be able to fulfil his wish. Mwanjale had an excellent season last year before picking up an ankle injury with eight matches to go. 
Then, the defender was United’s most influential player with his leadership qualities helping the team in their quest for the league championship. With Mwanjale missing in action, the Green Machine capitulated in the dying stages of the campaign and eventually finished in third place behind champions FC Platinum and second-placed Chicken Inn. Mwanjale still feels if he had remained fit to complete the season, it could have been different for Makepekepe. The former Mamelodi Sundowns defender is not sure what the future holds as he has an impeding second operation on his leg while the 2020 season remains a huge doubt. Currently, there is no football taking place in Zimbabwe owing to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The 2020 campaign should have commenced in March but at the moment most sporting activities have been banned until the virus is under control. There is a huge possibility there will be no football to be played locally this year with the season likely to commence in 2021 and by that time Mwanjale will be around 38. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); “This pandemic has made it even worse.” But whatever happens, and looking at his footballing journey, Mwanjale is grateful for everything the game has given him.
