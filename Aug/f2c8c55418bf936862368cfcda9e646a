mhlophes@dailynews.co Government has to take immediate action and support the inception of national dialogue to address the country’s mounting woes, a social movement, Citizens Manifesto, has said. This comes as the country has come under international scrutiny over alleged human rights abuses with various international players, including the United Nations (UN), calling on the country’s major political actors to engage in dialogue. Addressing a press briefing in Harare yesterday, Citizens Manifesto convenor Briggs Bomba said an inclusive dialogue was the only way of saving the nation from an imminent socio-economic and political implosion. “For us the beginning point of the dialogue is mediation and we believe that there must be mediation to simply establish an agreement on a framework that will then be used for dialogue. “Given the polarisation that exists internally we believe that this is a typical role for a former head of State or international statesman to simply run around and meet all stakeholders and come up with an agreement on a framework that everyone can subscribe to and allow the country to begin to speak.” Bomba further called on citizens to speak out against rights violations, adding that multilateral action was now critical to pull the country back from the precipice and total implosion. Speaking at the same event, Zimbabwe National Students Union president Takudzwa Ngadziore called on all students to take action against corruption and rights violations, saying these were derailing the country’s road towards development.
