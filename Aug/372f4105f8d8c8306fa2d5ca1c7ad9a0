chayav@dailynews.co.zw SONGSTRESS and comedian Mai Titi will launch her latest studio album tomorrow. The album, Rise will be launched online on ZBC’s Nash Tv programme and on her facebook page from 9pm.
The event will be supported by musician Andy Muridzo, Kikky Badass, Bryn K and Nyasha David among others. “Over the years, I was only focusing on singles but now I am going for an album. My first album was gospel. On this one, I have touched a number of issues mainly social,” Mai Titi said. The album comes barely two weeks after the single Hush, a collaboration with Tocky Vibes.
Last year, Mai Titi starred in a gospel music video Reurura by Mr Marlonsor featuring Tocky Vibes.
