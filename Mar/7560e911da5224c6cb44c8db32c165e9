TRANSPORT minister Joel Matiza, pictured, says government is currently evaluating the cost of Zimbabwe’s integration into the Kazungula one-stop border-post and bridge after it completed all of the pre-construction works. Plans for the 923-metre-long bridge linking Kazungula in Zambia with Botswana were first announced in 2007 by the governments of Zambia and Botswana to replace ferries connecting the two countries. Zimbabwe was later drafted in to be part of the project in 2018 joining the two countries, which had already started preliminary works on the border. “It might look as though nothing is happening, but there are pre-construction activities that need to take place and there is a gestation period,” the minister added. Matiza said all other pre-construction procedures, including feasibility studies and the appointment of a consultant, had been completed. The project is expected to greatly improve freight efficiency in the region. Construction of the bridge, which includes international border facilities in Zambia and Botswana officially began on October 12, 2014 and is due for completion this year.
