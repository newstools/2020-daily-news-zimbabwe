NEDBANK Zimbabwe Limited has appointed Sibongile P Moyo as its new managing director, taking over from Charity Jinya, who held the leadership rope for the past decade. In a statement last week, Nedbank company secretary Farai Sithole said Jinya retires on March 31, 2020, adding that her commercial acumen, wealth of knowledge and wisdom will be sorely missed. The newly-appointed Moyo is a seasoned banker with over 13 yearsâ€™ experience in the financial service sector having held executive level positions, including leading the integration of a foreign bank acquisition for Ecobank Group, Executive Director and Head of Domestic Banking at Ecobank Zimbabwe and Head of Financial Markets. Prior to joining Nedbank, Moyo was executive director at Altus Venture Capital and general manager at Norton Leaf Tobacco. She has also served as a non-executive director on the boards of Zimpost and of banking subsidiaries of the MyBucks Fintech Group in Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Moyo holds a Doctorate and Master of Science in Natural Resource Economics from the University of Alberta, Canada and Professional Banker designation of the Institute of Bankers of South Africa.
