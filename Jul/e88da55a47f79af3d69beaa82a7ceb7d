In BULAWAYO ORGANISERS of this year’s ROIL Bulawayo Arts Awards (BAA) have hinted that the annual ceremony will take place online. This also comes at a time various events and awards worldwide have been successfully taking place online owing to the Covid-19 pandemic which has seen a new order across the globe. With the now popular BAA’s having been earlier on thrown into doubt due to lockdown measures imposed by government to contain the spread of the disease, lately the organisers appear to have seen light at the end of the tunnel. One of the awards organisers Raisedon Baya said they are seized with the preparations. “We are working towards the awards. We haven’t fixed a date yet. We are obviously aiming for a virtual one. We are talking to partners currently,” Baya told Daily News. The BAAs which used to take place in winter were last year moved to August as part of the move to accommodate audiences who might have been kept away by the biting cold. Ever since the outbreak of the pandemic, the organisers have been in a catch 22 situation on how best to hold the event without having it lose its lustre and hype that has been associated with it since its inception a few years ago. This has seen the organisers till to date having not come up with the final decision or date despite that August was less than a month away.
