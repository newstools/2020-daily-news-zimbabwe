karongaa@dailynews.co.zw THE 2020 Zimbabwe National Bodybuilding and Fitness Championships (formerly Mr Zim) have been cancelled due to the continued spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19). Since March the government has imposed a nationwide lockdown which is still in place to curb the spread of the novel virus. In recent weeks, Zimbabwe has recorded a spike in positive cases with 25 people losing their lives thus far from the 1 611 confirmed cases. Although the national championships where set to be held in October, the sport’s regulators were left with no choice but to cancel the contest. Already, the National Federation of Zimbabwe and Bodybuilding and Fitness (NFZBF) has been forced to cancel the Mr and Ms Novice Championships which were scheduled for this month. NFZBF secretary-general Quiet Shangai said they will come up with a number of virtual activities to ensure that the sport is able to remain alive in the wake of these postponements. “The national body analysed the three critical players that kits a show and saw it fit to cancel the championships,” Shangai told the Daily News yesterday. “It is technically impossible for athletes to bring a stage-worthy physique on or before the 31st of December because gyms have been closed. “It’s not easy to create an environment of muscle growth and conditioning that is competent enough to step on stage between now and year end. The board also noted that most potential sponsors may not be able to support the nationals because of the economic environment caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. “Also the board looked at the safety of the fans who are owners of the sport. Are we going to be able to avail the right facility to enable safety in the auditorium in the event that Covid-19 will still be around?” googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });
