chayav@dailynews.co.zw GOSPEL music sensation Janet Manyowa, pictured, has been appointed to the Zimbabwe Music Rights Association (Zimura) board, replacing fellow gospel singer Charles Charamba who resigned late last year to focus on personal projects. The award winning diva will join Albert Nyathi (chairperson), Machanic Manyeruke (vice-chairperson), Witness Zhangazha (legal advisor), Phillip Chipfumbu, First Batani, Nathaniel Ncube, Dingumuzi Phuti and Ncube-Chimhini (executive director). Meanwhile, Zimura which boasts of over 3 000 members, last week revealed it will disburse a second round of royalties to the tune of $2 million to musicians. This comes after the organisation distributed the first round of royalties ($2 million) on July 1. The money is distributed according to the success of the musiciansâ€™ songs on the market including on radio and in public places such as night clubs among others. When the song is played on Star FM, the musician gets $0,75 per play while ZBC pays $5,31.
Last year the organisation, which is mandated to protect and promote the rights of music composers, authors and publishers paid royalties to at least 2 500 musicians and the highest paid musician pocketed $5 000.
