EDITOR — It is sad that most of us are unable to afford basic commodities like sugar, mealie-meal, meat, eggs, cooking oil to mention a few just because most of these are beyond the reach of many. Companies are also struggling and most of them have resorted to increasing pricing to ensure that they stay afloat but this has negatively affected the ordinary people who do not have adequate resources to buy these highly prices goods. Government needs to do something to ensure that families do not die of hunger and are able to provide for their dependents. Government should show that it has the concerns of ordinary people at heart. — Hungry, Norton.
