chayav@dailynews.co.zwSOCIALITE and musician Felistas Edwards aka Mai Titi will officially register her Trust which looks after the vulnerable in Harare.  This comes after a Mt Hampden-based good Samaritan Onai Nhiwatiwa was on Wednesday arrested by the police for illegally taking care of more than 70 vulnerable children without proper registration for her charity work.  She reportedly paid a      $6 000 fine and the children were taken to an unknown place.  “After all has been said and done, I called my lawyers in search of more legal information pertaining to what is needed if one wants to venture into charity work especially to do with children.  “Now I understand why Nhiwatiwa was arrested but we will do all we can to help her acquire the papers (licence) needed.  “Learning from her experience, I am inspired to register my Trust, which is going to look after a number of children in Mbare where we provide food, groceries and pay school fees for some of them. I want to register it so that I will not be found on the wrong side of the law,” Mai Titi said.  Mai Titi, popularly known for her social media skits and rants, told this publication her heart bleeds when it comes to children and disadvantaged groups in society.  “I grew up in a difficult situation and I really understand what it means not to have a penny or a plate of sadza. I believe God blesses you not because you are special but He wants to use you to help others in the community,” the mother of two said.  In the past two months or so, Mai Titi has done a lot in the community, helping the marginalised.
She was one of the first people to extend a helping hand to comedian Charles Merisi aka Marabha at a time when he was down.  She also helps her neighbours in the capital with borehole water on a daily basis for free.
