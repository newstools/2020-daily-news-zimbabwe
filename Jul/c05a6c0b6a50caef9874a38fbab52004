masakadzab@dailynews.co.zw THE Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) has urged the government to stop using State apparatus to instil fear in citizens as the country braces for July 31 demonstrations.  In a statement on the right of freedom to demonstrate and protest during the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic lockdown, the commission also urged State apparatus to desist from clamping down on dissenting political voices with vices such as torture.  This comes as the country braces for the proposed July 31 demonstration by opposition parties and civil society, calls for which have seen the arrest of the organiser of the planned protest  and leader of Transform Zimbabwe (TZ) party Jacob Ngarivhume.  The TZ leader is languishing in remand prison, waiting to answer charges of inciting public violence.
The government has warned those who join the protests that they will face the full wrath of the law, alleging they wanted to cause violence and anarchy in the country.  ZHRC also had a message to protesters to exercise their right peacefully. “In light of the impending protests scheduled for 31 July 2020, ZHRC urges all citizens of Zimbabwe to … take into consideration constitutional rights limiting provisions as well as the Covid-19 regulations which have been in place for the prevention and containment of the pandemic.  “In exercising the right to demonstrate and petition, interests of public safety, public order and public health should be taken into account and be allowed to take precedence,” the statement read.
ZHRC urged the government — through its security apparatus — to desist from punishing dissenting political voices.  “The State, through its apparatus, should desist from inflicting constitutionally proscribed measures such as torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment on dissenting political voices,” the statement read. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });
