 SPORTS WRITER ABSA Premiership side Bloemfontein Celtic are doing everything in their power to ensure Zimbabwe international defender Ronald Pfumbidzai enters South Africa ahead of the resumption of the 2019-20 season. The Zimbabwean is still stuck in Harare as he cannot travel to Bloemfontein due to the restrictions placed due to coronavirus (Covid-19). Pfumbidzai returned to Zimbabwe earlier this year before the lockdown as he was recovering from a groin injury.
With the Super Diski set to resume on August 8, the defender is now racing against time to return to his base. “But what I heard is that the PSL are also trying to see what they can do because even Jomo (Sono) raised it in the meeting. They said they will see what they can do even though they are not promising anything, but they will try.”
