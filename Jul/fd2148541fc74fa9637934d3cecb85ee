OPINION BLACK  EDWARD IN order to solve our problems we have to first identify them, but we human beings have an inherent flaw of not being able to give ourselves an accurate self-evaluation more often than not, so who else is better placed to rightly pick out our shortcomings other than our critics? Now and again, I pray that our leaders humbly accept criticism and not become defensive or, even worse, attack their critics. Shortcomings can’t be defended and attacks won’t make them disappear. There’s no doubt that it takes an enlightened leadership to realise that a government can’t operate optimally without critics constantly checking its performance, coming up with contrary views and compiling reports. The onus falls on the leadership to read those reports, analyse them and take corrective measures. Leaders must understand that critics are not the “bad dudes” and shouldn’t be treated as enemies of the State. Actually it is the bootlickers who are the bad dudes. In fact critics are a blessing, who — if their views are taken positively — will help in getting to the root of the issues being raised and add value to the performance of the leadership. Any government, anywhere in the world, has to be questioned on its decisions. When quizzed, it mustn’t jump to conclude that the motive is to destabilise it. Critics help in preventing chaos in a country as they push its leadership to pay attention to good governance and transparency as well as establish a tight system of checks and balances. The Daily News on Sunday and its sister paper the Daily News always give acres of space to critics to air their views. The leadership shouldn’t pay a blind eye to these reports. Recently the focus of some critics was on human rights and the two publications did an excellent job in capturing the gist of the reports. The critics addressed the issue of googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); Recently, United Nations (UN) experts slammed the government over its reported pattern of disappearances and torture, saying that they appear to be aimed at suppressing protests and dissent. The ZPP further said that the rights violations witnessed in June were an indication that Zimbabwe was sliding into full autocracy, characterised by artless arrests and abductions. The UN special rapporteur on rights of freedom of peaceful assembly and of association Clement Voule, presented a report to the Human Rights Council alleging the government is failing to implement sound economic and political reforms, while shrinking the country’s democratic space. Let’s embrace criticism in a bid to spruce up the image of Zimbabwe, which is viewed unfavourably by international investors.  Sponsored Links
