gokob@dailynews.co.zw EAT n Lick, one of Zimbabwe’s fastest growing fast food retail outlets, has rebranded in line with international trends as part of measures to increase its market share in the sector. The latest development comes at a time the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) has dealt a big blow to the restaurant business, where trade was restricted to only parcel service or take-away over the last three months. The company’s managing director, Tsitsi Musabayana, said Eat n Lick has also introduced new menus to cater for various tastes. “We have refreshed our brand and logo to suit our customers’ ever-changing needs, but our branches will maintain the signature warm service atmosphere and welcoming approach that led to the success of the first branches across the country,” she said during the launch of Eat n Lick’s new-look branch in Harare’s First Street yesterday. The company, which opened its doors in 2014 and now boasts of 13 branches across the country, has also launched a new self-service system that allows customers to make orders online. “The new system will not only help our clients to practice social distancing in line with World Health Organisation regulations, but will also see an improvement in service as customers can now make orders in the comfort of their homes or offices and come to our branches to collect at a convenient time. “In addition, we are also offering free service delivery within a 20-kilometre radius,” Musabayana added. Eat n Lick, which first introduced the shawarma to Zimbabwe, continues to enjoy brisk business due to its unique concept, which combines fast food and fresh confectionery under one roof. Musabayana added that the company was setting its eyes on expanding into new African markets.
