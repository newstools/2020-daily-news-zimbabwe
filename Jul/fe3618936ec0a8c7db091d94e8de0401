 THE late Simon Chimbetu’s commemorations will go ahead next month despite the coronavirus (Covid-19) national lockdown, the organisers have said.  Chimbetu also known as “Master of Song” died in 2005 at the age of 50. “Preparations for this year’s edition of Ndarangarira Gamba are at an advanced stage. They are actually going to be bigger and better as we are going to celebrate also the lives of other dendera music legends in the form of Naison and Briam. “It is going to be a three in one event. We have lined up an online concert to celebrate the life of the Chimbetus,” Allan Chimbetu, one of the organisers, told the Daily News yesterday. Chimbetu said he hopes the online concert will attract multitudes of viewers, hence making it big and better.
“Over the years, we celebrated the life of Simon through staging concerts in different parts of the country but this time around we are targeting even those outside the country through the online concert,” he said. The outbreak of coronavirus has affected every sector not only in Zimbabwe but the world at large. One of the most effective ways of containing the virus is through observing social distancing and the use of personal protective equipment that is face masks and gloves among others. In March, the government put in place a national lockdown as a measure to curb the deadly Covid-19 virus from spreading, barring all social gatherings such as physical musical concerts and weddings.
As a result, the majority of musicians have opted to stage virtual concerts to keep their fans entertained during the lockdown period. Meanwhile, Simon left a rich musical legacy and his songs are still enjoying fair airplay on local radio stations.
Some of his studio albums include Survival, Lullaby, Boterekwa, African Panorama Chapter 1 and 10 Million Pounds Reward among others.
