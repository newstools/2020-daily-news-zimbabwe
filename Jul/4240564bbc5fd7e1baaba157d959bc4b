chayav@dailynews.co.zwCOMEDIANNE Felistas Edwards aka Empress Feli 1, pictured, has made it on Trace Africa TV with her music video titled Utange Neni.  Popularly known as Mai Titi, Edwards has been humbled by the latest progress in her musical career. “Mai Tt pfeeee paTrace Africa. Gore rekitsi mew mew. Thank you Trace Africa, I am humbled,” she said.  Trace Africa, an Afro-pop music channel dedicated to airing the continent’s top music videos, has been instrumental in uplifting local musicians over the years who include Jah Prayzah, Shanky, Winky D, King98, Cynthia Mare, Nutty O, Tocky Vibes, Ammara, Buffalo Soldier, Mudiwahood and Ex Q among others.  Some of the songs by the Top Female Entertainment and Social Media Enterprise Business Leader of the Year award-winning artist include Makatendeka, Dzora Mwoyo, Kereke Dhukeke, Ndinouya Ikoko, I Miss You, Dzoka Undinyepere and Letting You Go featuring Kazz Khalif among others.  Mai Titi is more like the late Safirio Madzikatire aka Mukadota who was more popular as an actor than a musician.
Mai Titi is popular for her social media skits and live rants.  Recently, she exchanged harsh words with the United States of America-based cleric-cum-socialite Passion Java aka Twabam live on Facebook over goods and money donated to ailing comedian Marabha.
