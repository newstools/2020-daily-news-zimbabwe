 VICE President Constantino Chiwenga’s estranged wife Marry, pictured, is unfit to stand trial and is currently undergoing treatment, a Harare court heard.  Marry is supposed to stand trial on allegations of assaulting Delight Munyoro, the vice president’s househelp.
In her last appearance, Marry indicated she was supposed to undergo surgery. Yesterday, the court heard she is undergoing skin grafting procedures and would require time to heal before she can stand trial.  Through her lawyer, Beatrice Mtetwa, she showed the court photos of her condition.
State counsel Charles Muchemwa consented to her application for the matter to be postponed to September 17.  “We will postpone the matter because of the condition of the accused hoping she would have recovered,” he said.
Regional magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa postponed the matter to allow Marry to heal, saying she had the right to a fair trial.  The matter, which had been set on a roll from yesterday up to July 30, has now been set for September 7 to September 10.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); In her statement, Marry said on January 28, she went to collect her children from school following the ruling by the High Court and when she got there, she saw the complainant — Munyoro — sitting in a vehicle in the company of security details from the army and Central Intelligence Organisation.  Marry said she then went up to the car and asked Munyoro why she had instructed her younger children not to speak to their siblings and Munyoro responded that she should be grateful that she was caring for her children as Chiwenga could not look after them.  This reportedly resulted in an altercation but Marry insists there was no physical contact.
