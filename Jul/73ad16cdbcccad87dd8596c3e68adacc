CHEGUTU-BASED sungura musician Apiton Wezulu, pictured, has released his debut studio album entitled Kure Kwegava. The album comprises six songs and these are Kurambana, Monalisa, title track Kure Kwegava, Rihana, Mudzimai and VaPhiri. “I have invested time and a few resources such as money to come up with the project.
“I have confidence in it. If it is given the attention it deserves, it will make a huge impact on the market,” the Orchestra Mutinhimira front man said. The album was recorded at his Zulu Studios by Promise Wezulu, his young brother, a talented instrumentalist who plays drums, guitar and keyboards among others. Wezulu said he is happy that Chegutu area is fast becoming a musical town. “Chegutu is awash with musical talent but the majority of talent has died a natural death due to lack of promotions.
“Now slowly we are coming out,” he said. The late Chimbetu brothers, Simon and Naison, were among the pioneers to put the town on the musical map in the country before the likes of Obert Chari of the Mebo fame.
