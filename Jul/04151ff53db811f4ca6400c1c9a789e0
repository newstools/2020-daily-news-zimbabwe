  Vasco Chaya PROFESSIONAL masters of ceremonies (MCs) and club DJs have been hit hard by the coronavirus (Covid-19) lockdown as the showbiz and entertainment sectors have been closed since March.  Government banned all gatherings in line with the Covid-19 regulations which promote social distancing, wearing of masks and frequent washing of hands, among others.
Club MC Flame Ndombele said things were tough. “I was born an entertainer and my life was hinged solely on that. My job involves crowds; I have been reduced to a beggar as I have nothing to do.”  Ndombele, whose real name is Gift Nyazana, is a professional master of ceremonies and an upcoming musician. Over the years he has hosted weddings, graduation parties and performed on road shows.    Flame Ndombele has an album, Simuka, and a number of singles including Time to Celebrate.
Celebrated MC Andy Kayz concurred with Flame Ndombele, saying the situation has been tough.   Club Dj Joe Mentro told the Daily News on Sunday that all is not well in showbiz.     Dee Nosh is also into printing and designing. “We cannot compare this business to showbiz where we made a name through 2 Kings Entertainment.”  Seasoned club manager Yasin Dhala said bar managers are also suffering.   Meanwhile, the government recently launched a $10 million Covid-19 relief fund for artists and they are being encouraged to apply the money. Sponsored Links
