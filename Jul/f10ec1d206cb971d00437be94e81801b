 Vasco ChayaLIFESTYLE WRITERchayav@dailynews.co.zACTRESS Jesesi Mungoshi has blasted government for neglecting outstanding local artists like her late husband Charles, who she said died poor as a result.The veteran actress, popularly known as Neria, a name she earned after playing the lead role in the award-winning film Neria, told journalists yesterday at her home in Chitungwiza that her husband lacked government support.She said this after receiving a food hamper from government officials.“The government should support the arts sector, not only morally but even financially. Arts sometimes becomes a lonely business and maybe that is the reason why at times you see our own writers like my husband (Charles Mungoshi) — they die with nothing, no support and yet he put Zimbabwe on the map.“He got awards like the Commonwealth Writers’ Prize of Best Book in Africa twice, Nama award, and there is another award for Africa again but the government could not even recognise him to accord him national hero’s status when he died,” Jesesi, who recently turned 66, told the journalists on the sidelines of the donation.The food hamper was presented to the family by Acting Arts minister Paul Mavhima and deputy Arts minister Tinomudaishe Machakaire ina bid to cushion the family during the Covid-19 national lockdown.“So what do I think (of the government) as a woman and wife who was supporting her husband?“I know that what he was doing was not for the family alone but for the nation at large. He would spend all his time with budding writers, trying to help them to write but then you can see it for yourself.”Machakaire said he had taken note of Mai Mungoshi’s concerns. “It is good that she said it and as a government, we will consider what she raised and we will address them. So far, we are trying to help our artists with food hampers and money during the lockdown.”Mungoshi died last year at the age of 72 and he was buried at his rural home in Manyene in Chivhu.The internationally acclaimed author published 18 books including Makunun’unu Maodza Moyo (1970), Coming of the Dry Season (1972), Waiting for the Rain (1975), Ndiko Kupindana Kwemazuva (1975), Inongova Njake Njake (1980), The Milkman Doesn’t Only Deliver Milk (1981) and Branching Streams Flow in the Darkness (2013), among others.His achievements included winning the Commonwealth Writers’ Prize of Best Book in Africa twice and as a result was invited to meet Queen Elizabeth of England.One of his poems was curated by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2011 as a permanent display in Seattle, Washington in the United States of America.In 2003 he was conferred an honorary doctorate by the University of Zimbabwe, having won multiple awards which included Zimbabwe’s 75 Best Books where he was in the top five lists in both the Shona and English categories.His novel Waiting for the Rain has been prescribed reading for years in schools. This novel was published in 1975, the same year as his Shona novel Ndiko Kupindana Kwamazuva (How time passes). He received an International PEN award for both books.Mungoshi also took part in local Zimbabwean drama in the late 1980s to early 1990s, and played a role in a local drama Ndabvezera, which was produced by Aaron Chiundura Moyo.
