This comes as the Utakataka Express frontman told this publication yesterday that he turned down offers from companies that wanted him to do skits.   However, Moyo is still contemplating balancing comedy and music.   Moyo’s skits are mainly on Facebook and he has worked with comedians such as Lorraine Guyo of Ndinyengeiwo fame on a number of skits. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });   Moyo joined the music industry after the death of his legendary father Tongai who died in 2011.
