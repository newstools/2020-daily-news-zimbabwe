SOCIALITE Pokello Nare has rubbished claims that she is a bleaching queen, the Daily News reports. To convince her critics that she was born a “yellow-bone” the former Big Brother Africa housemate pulled her old photos from the archives and posted them on social media.   Most of the skin-lightening creams, pills, soap, jerry, injection and gels among others are smuggled into the country from neighbouring countries such as Zambia and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) among others.

Substances such as hydroquinone are suspected to be harmful.
