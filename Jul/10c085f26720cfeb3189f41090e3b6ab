mhlophes@dailynews.co.zw THE European Union (EU) has availed an additional US$7,33 million to step up Zimbabwe’s response to the lethal coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the Daily News reports. This comes as the country’s confirmed Covid-19 cases have gone up to 1 034, with 19 deaths and 343 recoveries, according to figures released by the Health ministry on Monday. Recently, the EU contributed US$41 million to support the country’s Health Development Fund (HDF) in managing key thematic areas, including maternal, new-born and child health, sexual and reproductive health and rights, medicines, vaccines and commodities, human resources for health, health financing, policy planning, and monitoring and evaluation and technical assistance and innovation. EU Ambassador to Zimbabwe Timo Olkkonen said the additional support would contribute to the supply of essential commodities, including personal protective equipment (PPE), diagnostic tests and the training of all frontline and community health workers on infection prevention and case management. He added that as part of the preventive measures, the grant would assist in developing innovative communication tools to maintain a high level of alert in the country and contribute to a better coordination among all partners supporting the health sector with the guidance of the Health and Child Care ministry. This comes as Zimbabwe recently received another major boost in its fight against Covid-19 following donations of over 134 oxygen concentrators by the Unicef. “I am reliably told that these concentrators draw oxygen from the atmosphere and filter unwanted gases, leaving oxygen only. They can feed up to five beds, which is an improvement from the ones we were using in the past. “In the past we had to refill the oxygen tanks elsewhere and was very inconvenient as it meant that patients could go for a long time without the oxygen,” Health and Child Care deputy minister John Mangwiro said during the handover ceremony. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });
