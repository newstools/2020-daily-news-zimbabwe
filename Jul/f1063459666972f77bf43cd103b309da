matarisem@dailynews.co.zw ZIMBABWE will soon be able to detect new coronavirus (Covid-19) cases at its borders following the arrival of mobile test laboratories in the country. The country is struggling to contain  the deadly coronavirus pandemic that has so far claimed 28 lives and infected over 2 000 people. However, health experts have said there could be unrecorded cases because the country has not been able to conduct adequate tests. Business tycoon Strive Masiyiwa said he acquired the laboratories to help Zimbabwe deal with the rising number of Covid-19 cases.  “A few weeks ago, someone made a presentation to me on a new Technology for T-Testing. I immediately spotted its potential to help African countries at borders and airports. It can also help airlines. It is called a Mobile Laboratory,” Masiyiwa said on Friday. The African Union (AU) Special Envoy added that he then dispatched teams to the border post and, working in collaboration with Zimbabwe’s Health ministry and the Immigration Department, built a full laboratory and staffed it. “Our plan is to put such systems at all border posts and airports so that people and goods can move quickly.
“Instead of waiting five days for results, they can get them within 30 minutes,” he said. The latest development comes after President Emmerson Mnangagwa said the country could not afford to be complacent given the fact that neighbouring South Africa was recording an exponential rise in cases, and now ranks fifth globally in terms of infections. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });
