FORMER Dynamos coach Lloyd “MaBlanyo” Chigowe has returned to familiar territory after he was included in the Zifa Northern Region Division One Youth Development Committee. Chigowe, who is currently the head coach at Division One side Black Tigers, is famed for his work with young developing players. The committee will be chaired by league secretary-general Sweeney Mushonga while Martin Changachirere, Lawrence Murumisa, John Remba and Nelson Nzombe are the other members. Northern Region chairperson Martin Kweza saluted the contribution Chigowe has made in football development over the years. “MaBlanyo was heavily involved in helping us come up with the structure we are having. We looked at people who can come and add value. “During holidays players will gather, say at Prince Edward, and the idea is to bring coaches from Europe to train selected players from our provinces. We are in the process of negotiating for sponsorship and very soon we should start.” In accepting the task Changachirere said he is prepared for the big challenge. “The thrust is not only to provide world class athletes but great personalities as well. Football is a team sport and as such team work will see us thrive in the development spectrum.” In their bid to become a model second tier league, the Northern Region have also appointed marketing and competitions committees to spearhead their growth. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); The marketing committee comprises Kweza as chairperson, Jabulani Ncube, Mike Madoda, Morris Mujuru and Tafadzwa Bhasera.
