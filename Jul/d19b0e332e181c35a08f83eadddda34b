HERENTALS have bounced back into the Premier Soccer League (PSL) after successfully appealing against their expulsion to the Zifa Appeals Committee.  The PSL Disciplinary Committee had booted out the Students after they had approached the High Court following their match-fixing charge.  According to football rules and regulations, all stakeholders are expected to exhaust remedies within the game right up to the Court of Arbitration of Sport in Switzerland before approaching the courts of laws.  In arriving at their decision, the appeals committee chaired by Stead Kachere agreed that the Students had erred in taking the game into disrepute by approaching they courts of law but the penalty was too harsh. The other members of the committee are Rodin Mzyece, Fadzai Mageza and Givemore Nyahuma.  “The expulsion of the appellant from being a member of the PSL is hereby set aside and the expulsion is suspended on condition that the appellant shall not within a period of five years from the date of this judgment commit the same offence of taking football disputes to the ordinary courts of law,” reads the judgment delivered yesterday.  The appeals committee also reduced the fine Herentals were ordered to pay from $100 000 to $70 000 while all the parties were ordered to meet their own legal costs.  Herentals were accused of fixing their match against Black Rhinos on October 19, 2019 at the National Sports Stadium, which they won 3-0 courtesy of Blessing Majarira’s first half hat-trick at the National Sports Stadium.  After the game, Rhinos sacked their team manager Gift Kamuriwo when he admitted he had accepted US$600 from his Herentals counterpart Oliver Chirenga to throw away the game.  After Herentals received summons to appear before the PSL Disciplinary Committee, the club approached the High Court in a direct violation of football statutes.
