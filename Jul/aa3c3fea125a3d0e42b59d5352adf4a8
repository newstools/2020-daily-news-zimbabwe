chayav@dailynews.co.zw ORGANISERS of the “Let Them Schools Arts Festival” have cancelled the annual event due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. The festival is held between July and August. Instead, the organisers are now focusing on plans to build an arts village in Domboshava during the Covid-19 national lockdown. “What we are doing now is to focus on our plans of establishing the village during this period in preparation for future events after the national lockdown,” she said. The village will be used to educate children, especially from urban communities, on the country’s culture. “Children will be able to visit the village as part of organised school trips or for camps during holidays. The village will be laid out in clusters of huts designed in contemporary and traditional styles from around Zimbabwe. Established in 2010, Let Them Schools Arts Festival was set up with the aim of promoting and nurturing arts and cultural activities among youth aged up to 19. To achieve its objectives, Let Them Trust, which runs the festival, has conducted music, theatre and ngano (storytelling) workshops in over 400 schools and has consequently impacted on the lives of over 200 000 children over the years. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });
