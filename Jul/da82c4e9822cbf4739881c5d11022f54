The facility will collect, preserve, interpret, and display objects of artistic, cultural and scientific significance for the education of the public.   The online edition of the After Shock: Life After the Cyclone Idai exhibition is already underway and the NGZ also mounted the physical exhibition last week in preparation of life after Covid-19 national lockdown. “The museum will go a long way in telling the Chimanimani story by the Chimanimani people.
