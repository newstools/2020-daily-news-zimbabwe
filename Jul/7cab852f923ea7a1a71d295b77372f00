MASHWEDE Village’s premium dance competition, Dance Off, will digitally hold its finals this Friday which will see the winner getting US$1 000 in cash. Nine groups battled it out in the semi-final on Friday last week and qualifiers for the final will be announced this Wednesday after reconciliation of online votes. Budiriro’s Young Talented Dancers, Expandables from Chitungwiza, Tasha and Charles from Kuwadzana, Black Excellence from Mbare and Mufakose’s Sesifikile are some of the groups that participated in the semis. A total of US$1 000 is up for grabs by the top group while runners up will get US$500 and US$250 courtesy of sponsors Mashwede Village. The organisers said there are plans to spread the competition and accommodate groups from outside the capital. “We are going national, only that the current lockdown has made intercity travel impossible for the groups but as soon as the situation changes we will have them,” Mashamhanda said. Meanwhile, Mashwede Village together with other arts promoters have been sponsoring the online shows during the Covid-19 induced lockdown. Mashwede Village is among the popular entertainment hubs in the capital and was not spared by the lockdown.
“This competition is also about us giving back to the community that has supported us. “We are optimistic this phase will pass, so we want the youth to unlock their creative minds and participate,” Mashamhanda said. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });
