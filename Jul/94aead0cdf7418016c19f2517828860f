 SPORTS WRITER FORMER Zimbabwe seamer Blessing Muzarabani, pictured, says he chose to abandon his international career at a young age in order to become a better player after signing a Kolpak deal with English County side Northamptonshire. After making his Test debut for Zimbabwe in 2017 against South Africa as a raw 20-year-old, Muzarabani chose to walk away a year later. During his short-lived international career, the quick made just one Test cap and played in 18 ODIs and six T20 internationals.
The lanky Highfield-born cricketer feels he made the right choice as it will help him understand the game better. With his Kolpak deal running out at the end of this current season, there is talk he might switch allegiance and represent England.
Muzarabani however, dismissed the idea of representing England. “I (do) not try to go anywhere else other than my country. I aim to continue my progress and become a better player.”
The issue of racism has been at the forefront “When we first came to England as a group, we encountered a lot of racial abuse. I was back then in the Rising Star academy and it just kept happening again and again. But it never affected me too much. It is one of those things that just happens.”
