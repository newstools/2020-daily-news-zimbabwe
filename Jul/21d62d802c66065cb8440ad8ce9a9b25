MBIRA teacher Trust Mutekwa, pictured, has been nominated for the Global Teacher Prize Award courtesy of Varkey Foundation. Mutekwa is one of the 50 finalists vying for the prestigious gong and is now competing for a place in the Top 10. The award comes with a cool US$1 million. “In 2018 . . . Mutekwa, spent six weeks at Mason as part of a US Department of State and IREX-funded project called Teaching Excellence and Achievement programme. “Today, we congratulate him on placement within the top 50 finalists of the Global Teacher Prize, a $1 million award sponsored by the Varkey Foundation,” reads part of the statement from the organisers.
Mutekwa works at St Giles Special School in Harare where he is a specialist teacher of students with visual impairment. “He is being recognised for his innovative methods for teaching computer skills by first teaching the children to play a musical keyboard instrument called the Mbira. Trust presents his approach at workshops and conferences for teachers and as well as on television and radio,” reads the statement. Mutekwa teaches children to play a variety of instruments and to perform in arts festivals, competitions, and commemorative events. “When his students entered high school and the opportunities to perform dwindled, Mutekwa established an annual arts festival to encourage children with disabilities to participate . . .” Mutekwa has expanded his teaching and projects to include green solutions to everyday challenges.
