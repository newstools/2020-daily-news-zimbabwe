tafirenyikam@dailynews.co.zw ZANU PF legislator Justice Mayor Wadyajena has warned President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his government that they risk losing the 2023 polls if they do not address the dire straits faced by skint cotton farmers across the country, the Daily News reports. In addition, the Gokwe-Nembudziya MP has also recommended that authorities immediately allow cotton farmers to access their money that is stuck in closed mobile money accounts. This comes as about 400 000 cotton farmers are battling to access more than $300 million which is currently trapped in EcoCash, following the government’s recent decision to clamp down on all mobile money platforms. Presenting a report in Parliament yesterday following a recent tour of cotton farming areas by the portfolio committee on Lands, Agriculture, Water and Rural Resettlement — which Wadyajena chairs — the MP painted a grim picture of cotton farmers’ livelihoods. “It is unacceptable that no explanation has been offered to mostly poor and vulnerable farmers who have been stranded without pay on account of the decision to suspend bulk mobile lines. “The short-changing of our poorest and most vulnerable citizens could not be condemned more categorically by the committee,” he added. All this comes as the government stands accused of failing to repair the country’s broken economy, which has since worsened following the collapse of the re-introduced Zim dollar against major currencies — leaving long-suffering citizens fearing the return of the 2008 hyper-inflationary era which shattered many businesses and impoverished millions of people. His committee made a raft of recommendations, including an increase in cotton prices and the opening of bank accounts for farmers, as well as the Reserve Bank (RBZ) of Zimbabwe facilitating the issuing of ATM cards while absorbing the attendant costs. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); It also called on the RBZ to unfreeze the more than $300 million trapped in the Cotton Company of Zimbabwe Econet merchant lines, which was meant to pay cotton farmers.
