LIFESTYLE WRITER AWARD-WINNING gospel music star, Minister Michael Mahendere, has dropped a Christian rock single which he hopes will broaden his following beyond Zimbabwe. The song titled Revival- I won’t be left behind is a foretaste of an Afro-rock project that Mahendere is working on. The Permitan 2019 Best Male Artist Award winner said the lyrics of the just-released song were inspired by a sermon delivered by United Family International Church (UFIC) leader and founder Emmanuel Makandiwa.  “It was an intense message that was preached by the man of God. He made a divine announcement that there’s a revival coming soon; a spiritual and financial revival coming. And I know that once he says something is coming, it will surely come,” the Nyengetera hit-maker said.
