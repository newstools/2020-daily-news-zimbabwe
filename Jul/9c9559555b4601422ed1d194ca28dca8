Muyaka who is a director and shareholder of Khloe’s Home and Décor (Pvt) Ltd wants the $500 000 and interest at the prescribed rate to the date of full payment if the order is granted. According to court records between November 17 last year and April 3 Murata who has over 270 000 followers on Facebook published several broadcasts on the platform and on Whatsapp about Muyaka whom she also calls Mai Khloe or Mai Maketeni. The court heard Murata labelled Muyaka a prostitute, witch, gossiper and accused her of blackmailing her clients.
The two were friends before they began accusing each other of jealousy prompting Murata to take her rage against Muyaka to Facebook.
