mhlophes@dailynews.co.zwPRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa last night fired embattled Health and Child Care minister Obadiah Moyo for inappropriate conduct, the Daily News reports.  This comes after Moyo’s recent arrest on allegations of corruption in connection with the awarding of US$60 million worth of tenders to Drax International — for the supply of Covid-19 materials although the company was not a pharmaceutical company, but a consultancy firm.
Moyo is out on bail of $50 000.  The local representative of Drax International, Delish Nguwaya — who is also facing two counts of fraud over the coronavirus materials procurement deals — was released from remand prison yesterday after he was granted $50 000 bail by the High Court.  The Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet, Misheck Sibanda, said last night that Mnangagwa had removed Moyo from Cabinet with immediate effect.  “Please be advised that his Excellency the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Cde ED Mnangagwa, has in terms of section 340, subsection (1), paragraph (f) — as read with section 104, subsection (1) of the Constitution of Zimbabwe — removed Dr Obadiah Moyo from the office of Cabinet Minister with immediate effect, for conduct inappropriate of a government minister,” Sibanda said.  Moyo became the second minister to be arrested and fired by Mnangagwa since he became president through a military coup in November 2017 — following that of former Tourism minister Prisca Mupfumira late last year.  Mnangagwa axed Mupfumira, who is currently facing a slew of criminal abuse of office charges before the courts, after she allegedly swindled the National Social Security (Nssa) of US$95 million during her tenure as Labour minister.
