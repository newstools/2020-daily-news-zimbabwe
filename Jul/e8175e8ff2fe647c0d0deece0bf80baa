in BULAWAYO BULAWAYO-BASED hip-hop outfit Killemol has featured local songbird and Afro-soul queen Qeqeshiwe Mtambo on a new track titled I Tried. The track has been scheduled for official release on July 11. Speaking to Daily News, the hip-hop sensation described their collaboration with Qeqeshiwe as one of their best. “This track is our gift to everyone who’s feeling hopeless in a romantic situation. You would never fully understand the issues of the heart and it is our utmost duty as musicians to not only go through situations but also express our pain and our vulnerability through music,” said Killemol founder, King Rodney. He added: “The sound in the upcoming track is something unique, it’s a fusion of jazz elements with a rap vocal twist to give one a musical cocktail.” The track was produced by Loshy and facilitated by Godwill Tasunga aka G – Factor. According to Rodney, the track is set to reveal “our versatile feature as a group, we are not necessarily limited to one specific genre and given the current global crisis which has sped up all digital and artistic capabilities, we decided we are not going to be left behind.” Killemol is a hip-hop outfit made up of King Rodney and Obby Masihoro. The group which hails from Emganwini high density suburb said they use different local languages in their trade as part of reaching a wider audience. Last year, the group topped the charts with their track Nomasonto. Other songs that have enjoyed fair airplay include Not Nice and Wuraya.
