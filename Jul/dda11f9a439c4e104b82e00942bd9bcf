matarutseg@dailynews.co.zw RUYAMURO Holdings yesterday pledged more support to the Zifa Northern Region Division One League after handing over a car to Cranborne Bullets midfielder Kelvin Chibunyu for being voted the league’s 2019 Soccer of Star of the Year. Chibunyu was the reason why Bullets won promotion into the top flight as he chipped in with some crucial goals.
Following some delays owing to the coronavirus (Covid-19), the midfielder finally received his vehicle — a Nissan Tiida sedan — yesterday at the Zifa House. Chibunyu could not hide his excitement and revealed his first port of call is to make sure he acquires a driver’s licence. Ruyamuro Holdings marketing executive Takudza Makwangudze pledged their continued support to the second tier league. “As Ruyamuro, we want to be an example among other corporate players in supporting football.
“We are going to continue supporting Northern Region and the hope is that as we grow, we will look at the Premier Soccer League and national level. For now, we want to even do much more than what we are doing for the League. The Northern Region has over the years emerged as one of the best run leagues of all the second tiers in the country and their chairperson Martin Kweza says they are already negotiating for their deal with Ruyamuro to go beyond the current timeline. “Our relationship with Ruyamuro is getting better, our contract is for three years and we have completed two so far and we are now left with one year,” Kweza said. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); “They promised us that they will keep their end of the bargain so we are expecting another vehicle from Ruyamuro. “At the same time, we are negotiating for an extension of this relationship. They are happy with how things are going, the progress that we are making as a league. I’m positive the partnership will be there for a long time.”
