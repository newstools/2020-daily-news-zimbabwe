ORGANISERS of the annual Mr and Miss Twins have called off this year’s edition of the unique pageant due to lack of sponsorship, the organisers have said. Meanwhile, they have started preparations for next year’s edition. The Covid-19 pandemic has not only affected the Mr and Miss Twins in the country but a number of arts events including the annual Chibuku Neshamwari Traditional Dance Competition and all musical concerts. As a result, some of the musicians have since resorted to stage online concerts which have proved to be of major benefit to them in terms of marketing. Organisers of the Mr Ugly contest recently revealed they are in the process of organising an online show this year.
Mr Ugly Contest is expected to be held in October and fans, dotted in different parts of the world, will be the adjudicators at this year’s event as it will be held online. The ultimate winner will be the one with many votes.
