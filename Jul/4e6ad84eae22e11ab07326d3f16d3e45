Fulton, who last month was elected the association’s vice president, expressed her desire to continue giving her expertise towards the development of the sport as head coach. “I love my coaching,” Fulton told the Daily News. The talented sports administrator has had lots of memorable highlights in her coaching career, among them accompanying top junior female athlete Andie Kuipers to the Youth World Cup in Switzerland. On her role as vice president she is expected to foster development in all provinces. “I am looking forward to working with the newly-appointed board and continue expanding our sport provincially. This season I am focusing on supporting Bulawayo to build the sport,” she said. “As a federation we will continue to maintain high standards of governance, event, athlete and coach development.”
