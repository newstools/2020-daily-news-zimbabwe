She was honoured for her contributions and accomplishments in the community living with albinism in the country and beyond. “I am honoured to be named to Diversability’s D-30 Disability Impact List. This is an immense honour that recognises the work of myself and 29 other disability leaders. Thank you to all who nominated me and continue to support all my endeavours. I am so grateful!” she said. “Through a nomination and selection process, the D-30 list honours the unique accomplishments of our most impactful community members globally. After receiving almost 400 nominations for almost 150 incredible leaders with disabilities globally, we are pleased to present the inaugural D-30 Disability Impact List on 26 July, 2020,” reads part of the statement from the Diversability. “We know that this list is not comprehensive of all the disabled people doing great work, we hope that this can be a catalyst for continuing to advance disability inclusion, leadership, and representation at all levels.” Mudzimu, who is the chairperson of the Miss Albinism Zimbabwe Trust, was appointed the coordinator of the newly formed body funded by donors such as the European Union, Christian Blind Mission (CBM) and Americans with Disability Act (ADA) among others. This comes after the country held its inaugural Miss Albinism pageant in 2017 to fight the stigma associated with albinism.
