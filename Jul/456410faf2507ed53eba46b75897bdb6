masakadzab@dailynews.co.zwPOLICE in Harare were on Sunday involved in a high-speed chase with an unregistered vehicle before arresting four men and recovering a pistol and iron bars.  Last week, the police warned that they would be pouncing on unregistered vehicles, most of them suspected to be used in criminal activities.  The police said they would be treating any vehicle without registration plates with suspicion as they move in to curb cases of robberies.  According to the police, on Sunday they conducted surveillance on the unregistered vehicle  and realised that its occupants were wearing hoodies and face masks.  Asked to pull over in the city, the police said the vehicle sped off, resulting in a chase which ended in Ruwa after the law enforcement officers fired warning shots. “The vehicle sped off, prompting the police officers to give chase from Harare central business district up to Ruwa. The vehicle only stopped after police fired warning shots,” the police said.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); In a related matter, the police arrested a suspected car thief in Bulawayo after disembarking from an unregistered vehicle and getting into a parked car. He was caught searching the vehicle.  “Members of the public are urged to be alert and wary of unregistered motor vehicles which are behind a spate of crimes varying from robberies, rape and theft,” national police spokesperson Paul Nyathi said in a statement.  There have been cases of people being robbed of their wares and dumped in bushy areas by wanton motorists.  “We urge all law-abiding citizens to drive vehicles with genuine number plates. Police officers will be strictly treating anyone driving a vehicle without registration plates with suspicion.  “The Zimbabwe Republic Police will impound all vehicles moving with no registration plates to curb cases of robberies, mushika shika among others,” the police said.
