THE Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights (ZADHR) hopes the government will put in place adequate logistical plans for a Covid-19 vaccine rollout programme. Zimbabwe is expected to receive a consignment of Covid-19 vaccines next year as part of the world Health Organisation’s (WHO) Covax Programme. Covax is a collaboration between WHO, GAVI and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) which aims at accelerating the development and manufacture of Covid-19 vaccines, and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world. Zimbabwe is set to at least get 3,2 million doses with frontline health workers, the elderly and those with underlying conditions at the front of the queue to get vaccinated. In order for the Covax project to work effectively, ZADHR is calling on the government to start laying the groundwork for the project. “ZADHR joins the rest of the world in acknowledging the scientific breakthroughs in Covid-19 vaccine development announced recently. ZADHR urges the government to urgently plan and budget for the nationwide free provision of Covid-19 vaccine to all citizens. “The urgent provision of resources, availability of cold chain vaccines infrastructure, smooth distribution networks and citizen education against vaccine hesitancy will prove to be important game changers in the fight against Covid-19 in the country,”  ZADHR said last week in their Covid-19 Monitoring and Advocacy Report. Zimbabwe just like many countries around the globe has seen a number of tender scandals surrounding the procurement of Covid-19 medical equipment. In that regard, ZADHR is advocating for authorities to ensure there is transparent distribution of the vaccine once it reaches our shores. “ZADHR urges the Health ministry to put in place a framework within its governance structures that shall oversee the acquisition, distribution and monitoring of the Covid-19 vaccine in Zimbabwe. “The state has an obligation to ensure that Covid-19 vaccine is available to all citizens in an equitable manner,” the human rights doctors said. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); Covid-19 national chief coordinator Agnes Mahomva last week told State media that Zimbabwe has been conducting a number of assessments in anticipation of receiving the Covax vaccines. “Results of these assessments have shown that Zimbabwe has made good progress in preparing for the rollout of a safe approved Covid-19 vaccine. “More preparations are of course still in progress. The additional preparations include finalisation of both internal funding mechanisms through the Finance ministry and external funding applications for the vaccine itself and ofcourse for the actual rollout process,” Mahomva said.
