 THE Ecobank Group has launched a programme for women-owned and women-focused businesses across its 33 markets, including Zimbabwe. The programme, which has been fittingly named Ellevate, has been designed to help women reach their full potential by empowering, growing and supporting them with customised financial and value-added solutions. In a statement, The Ecobank Group said it recognises the strategic importance of women on the continent and the need to continually support them to reach their full potential. “In developing Ellevate, we made time to understand the needs of women, what they really require from their bankers, and came up with practical solutions that will help bridge the identified gaps. Ellevate is an end-to-end comprehensive product suite that supports women-owned and women-focused businesses with differentiated business solutions that will unleash their potential “Ellevate by Ecobank is designed for businesses owned by women, managed by women, businesses with a high percentage of female board members or employees and companies that manufacture products for women,” said the Ecobank group executive (commercial banking), Josephine Anan-Ankomah. The Pan-African bank formally launched the women focussed programme on November 27 via a webinar. Sponsored Links
