 MATHIAS Mhere will unveil his latest studio album Talita Kumi tomorrow at the Harare Gardens. The album is his ninth studio project and it is made up of nine tracks. “The album was inspired by a Biblical verse, Mark 5:41 that encourages one in times of doubt, loss, financial crisis or hopelessness to always uplift the mind and heart and never give up,” Mhere said. “On the latest album, I collaborated with Blessing Shumba, Killer T, Sharon Manyonganise and Chelsea Mguni. The project is an inspirational one which encourages people in times of doubt, loss, financial crisis and hopelessness not to despair as God is there for everyone,” he said. He has also released albums; Tinoda Nyasha, Anoita Munana, Nguva Yenyasha, Glory to Glory, Double Double, Old Testament and Panogara Nyasha and Greater Than Solomon. Sponsored Links
