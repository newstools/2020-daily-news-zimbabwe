 By Tariro Sajeni PARIRENYATWA Group of Hospitals has suspended visiting times due to the surge in the number of Covid-19 local nfections and an increase in reported cases within their institution.  The hospital’s public relations officer, Linos Dhire, told the Daily News yesterday that the health institution had started limiting the number of people who can visit patients to one. “To ensure continued patient support from relatives, only the recorded next of kin shall be allowed in the ward for updates on patient’s progress and any other requirements needed for proper management of the admitted patient. “This measure has been necessitated by the need to protect in-patients, staff and visitors,” Dhire said. As the biggest referral health institution in the country, Parirenyatwa has a huge staff and patients which entails an enormous visitors’ ratio. As a result, staff have been exposed to infection from the deadly novel virus. “Since the beginning of the second wave, we have recorded 13 staff members and four admitted patients’ infections, all of which occurred in our green zone part of the hospital. “This is an indication of high levels of exposure of staff and patients; it has also been difficult to control the large numbers of visitors, especially as the majority were not following theguidelines. “We encourage everyone to follow the guidelines on prevention transmission of Covid-19 as we shall also continue to amend measures to control and monitor the situation as an institution,” Dhire said.
