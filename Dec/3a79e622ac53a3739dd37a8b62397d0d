ORGANISERS of the upcoming high-profile gig featuring Jah Prayzah and Winky D, scheduled for next week, have assured fans the event is going ahead as planned despite the coronavirus (Covid-19) national lockdown.  This comes as some musical events, including the Kariba Braai Out, have been cancelled due to non-compliance on behalf of the organisers as the government is still to lift the ban on musical concerts. It also comes as the local daily Covid-19 statistics are rising, with Zimbabwe recording 10 deaths from the deadly virus at the weekend. The Jah Prayzah, Winky D event, to be held on December 18 at the Harare International Conference Centre (HICC) is being organised by Kayse Connect. “We are only allowing a handful of fans into the venue, at most 100 people and the rest will watch it online. So, the ‘Best of Both Worlds’ is an online concert hence our fans should not be afraid,” Kayse Connect’s Elton Kurima said. Those that want to follow the concert online will have to pay a subscription fee of US$2 and has been oversubscribed by the diaspora. To attend the physical concert at HICC, one has to part with US$50. “The only difference between our concert and other online concerts is that ours is pay per view. We are happy with the number of tickets bought so far,” he said. Jah Prayzah and Winky D, who have shared the stage at the same joint on a number of occasions, are crowd pullers of note hence the organisers have inflated the fees for the physical  concert to limit the crowds. The Covid-19 national lockdown has affected a number of arts and entertainment events this year since March when the measure was put in place. Some of the high-profile gigs that were being planned by Kayse Connect this year but did not take place due to the
lockdown include the Burna Boy and the Urban Grooves Euphoria concert, among others. After the Jah Prayzah and Winky D concert, Kayse Connect will also host the annual Worship Experience concert on January 1 at the same venue. The Worship Experience gig will be an online event only accessed by paid-up viewers and a few VIPs. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); The Worship Experience concert will be headlined by South African gospel sensation Benjamin Dube, who will share the stage with local musicians like Zimpraise Choir, Janet Manyowa, Takesure Zamar, Michael Mahendere, Charles and Olivia Charamba, Tembalami, Mathias Mhere, Sabastian Magacha and Takudzwa Chihambakwe, among others.
