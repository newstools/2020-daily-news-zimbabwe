 By Perpetua Rojasi THE government says it has stepped up its efforts in going after cyber criminals and the net is closing in on online rogue elements, the Daily News reports. Speaking at the Cyber Security Awareness Talk held in Harare yesterday, Information, Communication Technology (ICT) minister Jenfan Muswere said cyber crimes were on the increase and there was a need to deal with the issue decisively. “We have seen reports of online predators engaging in identity theft and stealing money from consumer’s accounts, misleading advertisements for people to deposit money in criminals’ accounts and some have been defrauded using mobile financial services. “As a government, we would like to urge service providers and consumers to be alert to this threat and be cautious at all times as online fraud is on the increase. “I call upon all the respective stakeholders like the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (Potraz), the central bank, service providers and law enforcement agencies to collaborate in combating this scourge to protect citizens. “Today we are here to conscientise you of the risks we are faced with as a nation and the need to work together to ensure that the cyber space is safe and stimulating for everyone, especially businesses,” Muswere said. Muswere said his ministry had already demonstrated its commitment to address the issue of cybercrime by introducing the Cyber Security and Data Protection Bill, which is now in its second reading in Parliament. “The ministry, working with its stakeholders has designed a programme to train personnel in government ministries, departments and agencies on ICT skills and cyber security awareness. “This programme is expected to commence in the coming week.” Speaking at the same function, Potraz director general Gift Machengete said parents must ensure that minors use the internet responsibly. “Cyber security is also about creating a balance between privacy and protection for our children when they use the Internet. “It is about knowing the extent to which we monitor children’s online activity without infringing on their privacy rights,” Machengete said.
