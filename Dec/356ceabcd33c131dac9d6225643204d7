 PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa has assured Zimbabweans that his government will maximise efforts to
curb HIV/Aids prevalence by improving health service delivery.  Mnangagwa made the remarks during a State of the Nation Address to mark global commemorations of the World Aids Day yesterday, with Zimbabwe recording significant improvements in suppressing new infections, provision of antiretroviral therapy and health seeking behaviours of infected and affected persons. The health sector is in a dire situation, with most hospitals facing shortages of drugs, equipment and poor service delivery as nurses and doctors continuously engage in strikes. “Although this will be a long process aimed at restoring both quantity and quality of services offered, including health infrastructure, drug availability and optimal human resources, my government is working on long term solutions to address perennial strikes by health workers and restoring public confidence in the public health delivery. “We are still far off the mark of achieving zero new infections and should, therefore, redouble our HIV prevention efforts, focusing particularly on geographical areas and populations sub-groups with highest risk and new infections,” Mnangagwa said. The president hailed statistics recorded by the Zimbabwe Population-based Impact Assessment (Zimphia) which established that 97 percent of Zimbabweans living with HIV were now on antiretroviral treatment, up from 88,4 percent. New infections have also declined from 47 000 in 2016 to 40 000 in 2019 although HIV incidence has remained high among adolescents, girls, young women and sex workers. “My government remains committed to addressing the challenges we have faced related to the availability of foreign currency for the purchase of antiretroviral drugs. “I want to assure all people living with HIV that my government, in this new dispensation, will continue to prioritise allocation of foreign currency for the purchase of antiretroviral drugs, related medical commodities and medications for the health of our people. “My government will prioritise investments for the entire health delivery system and restoring the quality of health services without discounting attention towards HIV and Aids,” Mnangagwa added.
