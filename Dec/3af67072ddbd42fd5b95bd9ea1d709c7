 DEBATE has been raging across the country on why the government is not closing schools following increasing cases of coronavirus among learners.
Ever since schools reopened in September for examination classes after their closure in March when Covid-19 reached our shores, not a single day goes by without a report of confirmed cases. Zimbabwe has slipped back into a second wave of the pandemic and fears are that the virus will spread amid concerns that the country’s health delivery system may struggle to contain the pandemic. Anderson High School in Gweru became the latest learning institution at the weekend to be hit by the deadly Covid 19 when it recorded 20 positive cases. Last week saw a number of learning institutions recording Covid-19 positive cases. John Tallach in Matabeleland South recorded 189 cases, while in Mashonaland West province, Chinhoyi High’s infections have gone up to 65. Matopo High School in Matabeleland South has 10 positive cases, while David Livingstone Primary School in Harare recorded a single case. Other positive cases have also been reported at Chinhoyi University of Technology and Midlands State University. This has given wings to people calling for the closure of schools, but the government is adamant that the solution is not to shut down learning institutions, but to put in place measures to contain coronavirus. We agree with the government that schools should remain open. We have to learn that Covid-19 is the new normal and we must adjust and learn to leave with it until a vaccine is found. What is needed is to ensure that measures to mitigate and contain the pandemic must remain in full force. It is the responsibility of everyone to ensure that we continue wearing masks, sanitise and wash our hands and practise physical distancing whether we are home, at school or work. Throughout the world, industry and commerce and other sectors of the economy have been re-opened after long lockdowns. The world over schools also re-opened, but with strict measures put in place to contain Covid-19 and Zimbabwe cannot be an exception. All learning institutions must implement the standard operation procedures outlined by the ministries of education. We also need to guard against complacence in the fight against the deadly pandemic, which has ravaged world economics, killed thousands of people and infected millions since it broke out in China in December last year.
