  SINGER and social media sensation Felistas Murata, popularly known as Mai Titi, has lined up a collaboration with
rhumba heavyweight Awilo Longomba.
The duet is titled A life to regret and is expected on the market early next year. “I am about to travel to the United Kingdom this festive season where Awilo is now based, for this collaboration. We have finalised everything
to do with the song,” Mai Titi told the Daily News. Mai Titi said she is working to revive rhumba music in the country. “Rhumba musicians are not difficult to deal with. Apart from the Awilo collaboration, I have also secured a collaboration with Yondo Sister. I hope all these projects will help to revive rhumba music in Zimbabwe,” the mother of two said. The collaboration with the Karolina hit maker comes after Mai Titi’s debut studio album Rise. Also known as Empress Feli 1, Mai Titi has videos that are being played on Trace Africa TV, an Afro-pop music channel dedicated to airing the continent’s top music videos mainly from African musicians.
