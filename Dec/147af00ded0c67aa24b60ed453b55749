 By Onward Gangata ZIMBABWE Cricket (ZC) team captain Chamu Chibhabha is hopeful that the upcoming T-20 provincial tournament presents a perfect opportunity for him to rediscover his form and fine tune his game ahead of the Afghanistan tour early next year.  The T-20 tournament, which will be the first domestic competition next year, is scheduled to commence on January 4 to the 15th and the Chevrons captain has targeted the shorter version of the game to get his act together. “The Logan cup and the T-20 gives me an opportunity to work on my game and find some form because it’s really important that I step up and put some runs on the board,” Chibhabha intimated to the Daily News on Sunday. The 34-year-old who is currently nursing an injury has been under fire for his poor performances, having struggled with the bat during the Chevrons’ tour to Pakistan in October. However, Chibhabha is confident that when he regains his fitness, he will turn the tide and return to his best to lead the national team from the front when the Chevrons tour Afghanistan in January. “As an individual I have never doubted my abilities over the years and that has always been my strength,” added Chibhabha. “I am confident that I am going to get it right, it’s a bit frustrating that I am injured at the moment and can’t do much but I am hoping to join the Eagles soon.” The T-20 provincial competition is set to be used by the national team selectors to pick the squad that will tour Afghanistan but the skipper reckons the competition is much more important to the players than just preparation for the Asian excursion. “Any tour is important, not just the Afghanistan tour, any team we play against we always try to prepare as much as we can, so it’s not just about this tour but to have the mentality and back that up with the performance and win,” he said. The tour to Afghanistan will mark Zimbabwe’s return to test cricket, with the two sides set to play two test matches and three T-20 matches. Sponsored Links
