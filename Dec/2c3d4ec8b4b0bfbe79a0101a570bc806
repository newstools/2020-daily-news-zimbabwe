 COMEDIAN Carl Joshua Ncube is set to launch a new book titled Love, Sex and Marriage to educate his fans on relationships. Ncube told the Daily News the move was inspired by people who always asked him to share the secrets of his relationship with wife Nelsy. “Fans have always been asking what our (me and my wife Nelsy) secrets are. Well, the book is a 2021 project but I
have started posting some of the chapters online. The book talks about my experiences on the relationship subject,” Ncube said. The book is expected to go a long way in fighting against gender-based violence. “It is my hope that it will help all who believe in the approaches and lessons I have learnt. Healthy relationships and
marriages are the backbone of a good society. Our support structures of advisors have gone. “Marriage counselling and relationship advice is desperately needed in Zimbabwe. I do it a lot in my comedy and my wife and I do it publicly just to inspire a different approach to love. We are not experts or pretend to be perfect, but we are perfect for each other,” Ncube said. Ncube has three published motivational books. “Love, Sex and Marriage is going to be my first book on relationships,” he said. Currently, the world, Zimbabwe included, is commemorating 16 days of Activism Against GBV. The Southern African Development Community (Sadc) Gender Protocol Barometer 2020 revealed that 68 percent of women in Zimbabwe have experienced gender-based violence while 46 percent of men have perpetrated violence against
women. This also comes as the Musasa Project recently revealed that its centres have assisted over 10 000 violence survivors since the beginning of the Covid-19 induced national lockdown in March. Sponsored Links
