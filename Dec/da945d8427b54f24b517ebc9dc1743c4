 A SECOND memorial service for the late socialite Mitchelle “Moana” Amuli is on the cards as the rift between her parents continues to widen. This comes as the Amulis (her father’s side) held their own memorial service dubbed Sadaka three days after Moana’s burial. Now her mother Yolanda Kuvaoga is in the process of organising her own memorial service for the late socialite and fitness enthusiast. “Mitchelle’s memorial service is set for January 2 in Highfield. I was not part of their Sadaka as I do not understand their Islamic culture. In short, we have failed to agree on everything, from the burial,” Kuvaoga told the Daily News. Moana died in a horrific car accident on November 8 alongside socialite and businessman Genius Kadungure aka Ginimbi and two of their friends from Malawi and Mozambique along Borrowdale Road in the capital. The accident occurred minutes after the quad had celebrated Moana’s 26th birthday at the Dreams nightclub (owned by Kadungure) in Harare. They were heading to Kadungure’s Domboshava mansion. Moana was later buried at Warren Hills cemetery (Muslim Section) in the capital in line with her father’s Islamic culture after a struggle as Kuvaoga preferred Zororo Memorial Park along Harare-Chitungwiza Road. It took 20 days for the family to bury the late mother of one due to a cocktail of reasons ranging from parents’ disputes and the delay in the DNA results as she was burnt beyond recognition in the accident. The results of the DNA took more than a week to be announced and by the time they came out, her parents had failed to agree on how and where the late socialite would be buried. Moana’s mother approached the courts to cancel the burial order that had been issued in the name of Amuli as she was suspecting her ex-husband had acquired the burial order clandestinely. However, the court ruled in favour of Amuli saying he has the right to bury his daughter the way he wants considering he played an influential role in raising Moana in the absence of the mother.
