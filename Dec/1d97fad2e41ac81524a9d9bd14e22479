 THE motion of no confidence against South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa was yesterday postponed.
The motion was brought by the African Transformation Movement (ATM). The vote was meant to be held in Parliament late last night. But it has now been set back pending the outcome of the ATM’s review application, which is set down for early February 2021. The party had approached the Western Cape High Court to try and have the motion dealt with through a secret ballot. The ATM is claiming that National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise acted irrationally and with bias in turning down the party’s request for a secret ballot. The ATM is arguing that a secret ballot will allow MPs to vote according to their consciences rather than toe their
party’s line. But Modise said that the ATM had failed to make a case for the special circumstances that might require a secret vote. “Both legal teams of ATM and the Speaker have agreed to ask the Speaker to postpone the #NoConfidenceMotion against President Ramaphosa following the postponement of the Secret Ballot case to 3rd and 4th February 2021,”
ATM said in a tweet yesterday. — eNCA News Sponsored Links
