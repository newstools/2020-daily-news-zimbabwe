 By Aaron Nhawu ZIMBABWE Volleyball Association (ZVA)’s elective congress held at Chevron Hotel in Masvingo on Saturday ushered in a new leadership, with former treasurer Mxolisi Ndlovu ascending to the throne as the new president. Ndlovu, who was recently appointed Zone VI treasurer following the election of former ZVA president Ringisai Mapondera to the regional association’s SG position, beat Tawanda Sithole, who held the SG post for the last four years, 12-8 in a closely contested affair. “I would say the election was balanced and closely contested, showing that the quality of all candidates was good,” Ndlovu told the Daily News yesterday. “Personally, the victory gives me confidence first on my performance in my role and the zeal to work harder going forward. “My vision is to see the ball rolling towards competitions, commercialisation of the game, brand visibility. “I would like to see more capacity building and talent development taking place, ensuring corporate governance and sound administration as well as to foster an environment for equal participation and sport for all.” Sponsored Links
