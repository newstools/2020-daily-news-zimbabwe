 ZIMDANCEHALL music star Tocky Vibes celebrated his 27th birthday with a big bash at Hellenic Sports Club on Sunday.   Surrounded by friends, the bash coincided with the chanter launching his 10-track singles collection titled Long Live Chama featuring Jah Prayzah, Edith WeUtonga, Poptain and Madam Boss. Tocky Vibes was supported by fellow musicians who performed at the bash which was hosted by local entertainment industry benefactor Boss Spencer. First to perform was budding Nicky Vibes who left the stage for Poptain who had people singing along to his popular Fadza Mutengi Wedoro. Exciting dancehall star Enzo Ishall also had a moment to showcase his artistry with a number of sing along tunes, among them Bhiza Rinoda Mutasvi, Siya Something and Urikutsvireiko. Tocky Vibes then came on stage before being joined by Ricky Fire and Andy Muridzo. The singer took fans down memory lane with a number of his yesteryear hits such as Mhai before sharing a new single with Poptain, Mari Yese. The new singles collection is made up of potential hits such as Mai VaJoana featuring Jah Prayzah. His relationship with Jah Prayzah had been a mysterious one but all the doubt has been cleared with this  release. “Form is temporary but class is permanent and this has been shown. I’m happy with how people responded on such short notice. I had to give music lovers a Christmas present in the form of the singles,” he said. South Africa music promoter Boss Batsi of 2639 forked out US$300 for the music CD. Sponsored Links
