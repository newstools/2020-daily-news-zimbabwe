 INFORMAL traders are not happy with the government’s introduction of the US$30 presumptive tax which landlords have been mandated to start collecting next year, saying it would worsen their already desperate situation.  This comes after Finance minister Mthuli Ncube in his budget statement thrust the obligation on landlords to start collecting the monthly taxes from January 1, failure of which would result in a penalty equivalent to the US$30 with interest. Ncube also set presumptive taxes for bottle stores and restaurants at $10 000, hair dressers $2 500 and $10 000 for cottage industry. “A number of enterprises operate from designated business premises where the landlords are either local authorities or private property owners. The fixed nature of business thus presents an opportunity for the tax administration to improve tax collections from presumptive taxes,” Ncube said. “Landlords will be responsible for collection of the taxes which take effect from January 1, 2021. Landlords that fail to collect and remit the tax will be subjected to a penalty equivalent to the amount of tax payable and interest.” Vendors Initiative for Social and Economic Transformation (Viset) leader Samuel Wadzai said impoverished informal traders were actually looking up to the government for assistance as their business had been grounded because of Covid-19. “It goes without saying that landlords will simply pass on this tax to vendors and informal traders who are then forced to hike prices in response to this new cost,” Wadzai said. Zimbabwe’s informal workforce, who comprise up to 85 percent of the country’s total number of workers, is struggling to recover from Covid-19 lockdown imposed by the government in March. The government, through the Social Welfare ministry, pledged to provide safety nets and subsidies to vulnerable communities to mitigate the effects of Covid-19 on the welfare of citizens. However, Viset said it noted with concern how Ncube’s budget statement did not provide a comprehensive social protection programme to protect the vulnerable. “It is also disheartening to see that judging from the allocation to the Public Service and Social Welfare ministry $6 929 million, there does not appear to be provision for a comprehensive social protection programme to protect the vulnerable, implying that no lessons were learnt from the Covid-19-induced lockdowns when many households were left economically vulnerable,” Wadzai added. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); “While it is understandable that the minister should seek to widen the country’s tax base, this should not be at the expense of the ordinary citizen. “Rather, the government should come up with policies that ensure plugging of loopholes that unscrupulous people make use of in the smuggling of gold and other mineral resources, thereby depriving the country of revenue that could be channelled to the provision of social services.” Sponsored Links
