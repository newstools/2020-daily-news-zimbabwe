ZIMBABWE born former international rugby player Tendai “Beast” Mtawarira has been named in the World Rugby Team of the Decade. The Beast, as he is affectionately known in rugby circles, called time on his international career in style after winning the 2019 Rugby World Cup with South Africa. The former Peterhouse and Churchill schoolboy rep resented South Africa from 2008 until last year, with his biggest achievement with the Springboks winning the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan. The 35-year old Mtawarira retired from international rugby in November last year having represented South Africa internationally 117 times since he made his debut against Wales at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria in June 2008. Two other Springbok Rugby World Cup winners, Bismarck du Plessis and Bryan Habana, joined Mtawarira on the World Rugby 15s Team of the Decade list during the World Rugby Awards Special Edition held on Monday. The awards celebrated members of the rugby family who have provided outstanding service during the Covid-19 pandemic as well as players and teams who have starred over the last decade in a virtual show. Instead of the traditional awards celebrating performances on the pitch in 2020, supporters had the opportunity to vote for their six favourite players and tries of the decade award winners, with the World Rugby Awards’ starstudded panel given the difficult task of selecting two teams of the decade. A total of six nations are represented in the World Rugby Men’s 15s Team of the Decade in association with MasterCard, selected by the star-studded panel, with New Zealand contributing seven players, three from South Africa, two from Ireland and one each from Australia, Italy and Wales. The Team of the Decade boasts a total of 1 637 Test caps between them. World Rugby Men’s Team of the Decade:
15 Ben Smith (New Zealand), 14 George North (Wales), 13 Brian O’Driscoll (Ireland), 12 Ma’a Nonu (New Zealand), 11 Bryan Habana (South Africa), 10 Dan Carter (New Zealand), 9 Conor Murray (Ireland), 8 Sergio Parisse (Italy), 7 Richie McCaw (New Zealand), 6 David Pocock (Australia), 5 Sam Whitelock (New Zealand), 4 Brodie Retallick (New Zealand), 3 Owen Franks (New Zealand), 2 Bismarck du Plessis (South Africa), 1 Tendai Mtawarira (South Africa).
