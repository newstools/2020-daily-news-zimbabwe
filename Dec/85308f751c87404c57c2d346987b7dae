  INFORMATION Communication Technology (ICT) minister Jenfan Muswere says there is need to be more vigilant when it comes to ensuring citizens are protected from cyber criminals. Speaking at the Computer Society of Zimbabwe ICT summit in Nyanga at the weekend, Muswere said the government is working tirelessly to protect people from different online scams through the Cyber Security and Data Protection Bill. “The fourth industrial revolution brings with it many technologies such as artificial intelligence, Internet of things, robotics, virtual reality, the cloud, and 3D printing which present vast opportunities in the entirety of the
economy. “However, let me hasten to point out that it is not going to be smooth sailing. With the increased utilisation of these technologies also come new complexities, particularly in ensuring data protection and privacy. What comes to mind, immediately, are the cyber-security implications. “As we transact, innovate, communicate, disseminate, and explore the fundamental question is ‘Who is policing the fair use, safety, and intrusion of the cyber space?’ This is perhaps one of the biggest puzzles of this time, which myministry is hard at work resolving, through our efforts directed towards the Cyber Security and Data Protection Bill,” Muswere said. While there has been some resistance to the Bill by activists, who are claiming it gives the government power to snoop on citizens, Muswere said the legislation would provide a legal framework upon which all cyber security superstructures are to be built on. “Our vision is to build a robust framework which is watertight and provides a safe and secure environment to allow enterprises and organisations whose business is now anchored on ICTs to operate efficiently in this peculiar fourth industrial revolution. “One of the most exciting possibilities in this era is achieving efficiency in e-commerce, which is inextricably attached to the government’s objectives under the ‘Ease of doing business’ initiative. It is the next level which  has been accelerated by the pandemic, and all sectors of our economy have embraced, in an impressive fashion, conducting business online. “We are truly walking through a significant time in the history of this country, and the world,” Muswere added.
