 THE estranged and ailing wife of Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, Marry, was yesterday taken to the Harare Magistrates’ Courts in an ambulance for the cancellation of two warrants of arrest that had been issued against her, the Daily News reports. The warrants had been issued earlier in the morning by regional magistrate Ngoni Nduna, after Marry failed to appear in court to answer to allegations of money laundering and attempting to kill Chiwenga. This comes as the powerful VP and Marry are going through an acrimonious divorce. Yesterday, Marry’s lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa had earlier told the court that her client was not well, and was at home as she could not walk. But Nduna said Marry could not be remanded at home, immediately issuing warrants of arrest against the former model. Mtetwa later arranged for the appearance of Marry at the courts in the afternoon, in an ambulance — who was stretchered into regional magistrate Trynois Utahwashe’s court. The magistrate subsequently cancelled the two warrants of arrest, with the matters remanded to January 28 next year. The State also indicated yesterday that it needed to carry out extra-territorial investigations which had been stalled by the Covid-19 pandemic, before the matter went for trial. Mtetwa submitted that the State would have to provide the defence with trial dates, or they would challenge Marry’s further remand — as no one knew when the Covid-19 pandemic would end. As Marry sat in a wheelchair in court with ambulance technicians by her side, she had visibly swollen hands. Chiwenga and Marry are going through a nasty divorce, with the vice president alleging that the former model intended to kill him when he was ailing in a South African hospital in July 2019. Chiwenga has also accused Marry of money laundering and fraud. In turn, Marry has hit back at the retired former military commander, accusing him of fabricating charges against her in a bid to fast-track their divorce. The attempted murder charges against Marry arose last year when Chiwenga was airlifted to South Africa for medical attention. Upon arrival in South Africa, Marry is alleged to have forced Chiwenga to stay at the Sheraton Hotel in Pretoria, before denying him access to medical attention. Security details reportedly had to use force and took the vice president to Netcare Hospital, where she later allegedly removed an intravenous set and a catheter that were sustaining Chiwenga’s life. The general is said to have bled profusely. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); Prosecutors claim that Marry was only intercepted by security personnel while attempting to take Chiwenga out of the hospital ward. But Marry has said the claims and evidence by the State were “utterly useless”. She has said she was ill and that in that condition she would not have been in a position to drag a “whole army general” from a hospital bed as alleged by the State. Marry also said that there was no report from the doctors who allegedly attended to Chiwenga and resuscitated him when she reportedly removed the intravenous set and the catheter. She also wondered why the attempted murder was not reported to the South African police in the first place. Sponsored Links
