  By Tariro Sajeni ZIMBABWE has recorded 378 maternal deaths from January this year, with Sally Mugabe Central Hospital recording the highest number at 42, the Daily News reports.
Maternal death is the passing away of a woman during and following pregnancy and childbirth due to preventable causes. Of the deaths, 312 occurred at health facilities around the country while 66 were recorded at home, according to statistics released by the Health ministry yesterday. However, of all the major referral hospitals in the country, Sally Mugabe Hospital in the capital had a high ratio of maternal deaths. The institution delivered 4 855 live births, but sadly close to 50 women lost their lives. Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals delivered 6 160 live births with 19 women passing away, while Chitungwiza Central recorded 12 deaths out of 2 513 deliveries. On the other hand, Mpilo Central and United Bulawayo Hospitals recorded 10 and eight maternal deaths respectively during the same period. “Top five causes of maternal deaths are: bleeding after giving birth (26 percent), hypertensive diseases (16 percent) — high blood pressure which leads to violent fits during pregnancy), puerperal pepsis (10 percent) – fever and pain due to infection of the genital tract of a woman that occurs from the breaking of the waters (rapture of the membrane) or labour up to 42 days after giving birth; post and peri arbotal sepsis (nine percent) — serious infection of the uterus (fever and pain) due to induced abortion and caesarean section ( five percent),” the Health ministry said in a statement yesterday. The ministry said it was undertaking a number of initiatives to ensure that this high number of maternal deaths would be reduced moving forward. They have launched a Maternal Death Surveillance and Response (MDSR), which would involve reporting and auditing of all maternal deaths as and when they occur which will provide crucial data for planning purposes in order to plan and mitigate future occurrences. Health authorities have also launched a clinical mentorship programme for nurses and doctors at provincial and district levels which would equip them with emergency obstetric and neonatal care training. The ministry also urged expecting mothers to make use of maternity waiting homes where they would be provided with vital health care before labour. Procurement of essential maternal and new-born health equipment like drugs and consumables, including blood and related products, would also be prioritised to combat this scourge. The ministry is also implementing improved family planning services and training service providers on the WHO nine standards on youth friendly service provision. Sponsored Links
