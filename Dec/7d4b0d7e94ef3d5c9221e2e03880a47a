  ORGANISERS of the Post-National Budget Business Breakfast Forum, which was headlined by Finance minister Mthuli Ncube and Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor John Mangudya last Monday, have described the event as an “unqualified success.” The Associated Newspapers of Zimbabwe (ANZ) – publishers of the Daily News and the Daily News on Sunday- hosted the oversubscribed event as part of ongoing efforts to create a dependable platform to discuss issues of national significance. “When the Daily News Business Breakfast Forum was created a few years back, the aim was to create a platform on which policymakers, businessmen, decision makers and citizens could converge to discuss topical national issues. This is exactly what we did on Monday; we made it possible for the Finance minister and the RBZ governor to unpack the budget for the benefit of all Zimbabweans,” said ANZ general manager sales and marketing, Plaxedes Meck. She added that they were working on making the event even better by forging partnerships with more corporates and business organisations. “The Daily News Business Breakfast Forum has become a peerless brand thanks in part to the partnerships we have built. For the event we held last Monday, we would like to express our gratitude to our gold sponsor, the Infrastructure Development Bank of Zimbabwe (IDBZ) and our silver sponsor, Agribank. We are also grateful to our partners, who included Pepsi, Hypoguard, Passion Events & Deco, Financial Gazette and Icaz,” said Meck. Apart from the Finance minister and the RBZ governor, the event also included a panel made up of experts and representatives of various business organisations.The panellists  included Institute of Chartered Accountants of Zimbabwe (Icaz) chief executive officer Gloria Zvaravanhu, Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries president Henry Ruzvidzo, Bankers Association of Zimbabwe president Ralph Watungwa, veteran economist Naome Chakanya from the Labour and Economic Development Research Institute of Zimbabwe (LEDRIZ) and chief executive officer of Zimbabwe Women’s Microfinance Bank, Mandas Marikanda.
