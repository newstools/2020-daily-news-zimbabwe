 PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa has emphasised the need for the Judiciary to prioritise the fight against corruption in order to restore public confidence in the legal system and promote development.
Mnangagwa was addressing stakeholders in the justice delivery system at the launch of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) 2021 to 2025 Strategic Plan in the capital yesterday. The launch was graced by Vice President Kembo Mohadi, Justice minister Ziyambi Ziyambi, United Nations resident coordinator Maria Ribeiro, chief justice Luke Malaba and his deputy Elizabeth Gwaunza and various other stakeholders. JSC’s strategic plan seeks to ensure judicial independence, accountability, universal access to justice, capacitation of customary and local courts, strengthening institutional capacity to deliver high quality justice, among other initiatives. Mnangagwa applauded the JSC for taking a proactive approach to ending the corruption scourge and made particular mention of the scrutiny of magistrates and judges. He recently fired former High Court judge Justice Francis Bere for misconduct before setting up a tribunal to investigate another judge Erica Ndewere — who is accused of delaying delivery of judgments and failing to meet her
quota during execution of duties. “The prime importance of our citizenry’s confidence in the justice system and accountability of the judiciary cannot be overemphasised. “To this end, I commend the JSC for putting in place anticorruption mechanisms within the judicial service to enhance transparency and hold its members, including judges and magistrates accountable. “As you implement your strategic plan, the government expects that priority is accorded to judicial processes which instil confidence among our people and promotes the protection of property rights, among other aspects. “These will serve to complement and facilitate our quest to speedily modernise, industrialise and grow our economy for an empowered society as well as better quality of life for our people,” Mnangagwa said. The JSC intends to decentralise and decongest the courts; and increase the number of specialised
courts and victim friendly units. “As outlined in the 2021 National Budget Statement and in line with our devolution thrust, my administration will avail the requisite resources to speedily decentralise your functions as outlined in the strategic plan. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); “I applaud the judiciary for its responsive and methodical role in promoting the ease of doing business reforms since the advent of the second republic. Various interventions to enhance dispute resolution must continue to be strengthened. “The setting up of effective and efficient commercial dispute resolution mechanisms, an electronic case management system and the automation of court processes as well as the establishment of stand-alone commercial courts in both the lower courts and the High Court should be speedily concluded,” the president said. The JSC said it would be engaging community representatives, public interest groups, legal practitioners and academia to improve public confidence in the integrity of the court system. “The JSC will undertake stakeholder surveys to assess the degree of satisfaction with judicial services. Such criteria as accessibility, efficiency, transparency, affordability, integrity, and protection of human rights will generate qualitative data that will be analysed to measure useful public perceptions,” Malaba said in the strategic plan. “Judicial education and resource adequacy are the two critical inputs to the enhancement of judicial competence, efficiency in service delivery, quality of justice and the rule of law.” Sponsored Links
