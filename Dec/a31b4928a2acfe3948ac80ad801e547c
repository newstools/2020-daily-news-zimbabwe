 Perpetua Rojasi STAFF WRITER rojasip@dailynews.co.zw CHURCHES say they are ready to provide evacuation centres for people in the eastern parts of the country who may be affected by Cyclone Chalane that is expected to hit the area tomorrow. This comes after the Metrological Services Department raised concerns over the anticipated cyclone. Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC) secretary general Kenneth Mtata said mission churches have activated their preparedness plan in response to the expected cyclone. “A number of mission schools have been designated as evacuation centres and the ZCC has been attending Civil Protection Unit meetings in the affected districts, mainly Chipinge and Chimanimani. “We have put aside a small fund for food support, and a 4×4 vehicle has already been deployed to Chipinge for mobility,” Mtata said in a statement yesterday. He added that during the Cyclone Idai disaster, the ZCC trained pastors in psychosocial support (PSS). “The ZCC has activated its member churches across the country in all provinces to support the Met department in disseminating accurate early warning or cyclone tracking information, using different languages. “The ZCC has also put in place four staff members, including two managers, to be on standby to accompany the response teams,” said Mtata. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); Meanwhile, the ZCC is reaching out to partners for further support to assist families that could be affected by the cyclone with food, non-food items, shelter, water and sanitation, education, health, and counselling services, depending on community needs. The ZCC played a major role in assisting victims of Cyclone Idai, which hit Chimanimani last year. Sponsored Links
