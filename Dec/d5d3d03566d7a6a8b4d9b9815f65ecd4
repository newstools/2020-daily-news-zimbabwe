  By Aaron Nhawu HARARE Body Building and Fitness Association (HBBFA) is set to host their only event of the year, the Harare Classic Open at the Zimbabwe College of Music in the capital this Saturday.
The athletes are scheduled to battle for supremacy in various categories including senior men body building, men physique, men fitness as well as crowds favourites in women bikini fitness as the association continues with their mandate and vision in promoting gender balance. Bodybuilder and one of the event organisers Garikayi Mujuru said the preparations for the event were at an advanced stage and they are looking forward to a high turnout as this is the only show scheduled for this year. “We are hoping to have more than 50 athletes taking part in the event and all the preparations to make the event a memorable one are being worked on round the clock,” Mujuru told the Daily News. “The overall winner is going to walk away with US$600 in addition to that we are going to award $200 for the top prize in each category. Mujuru added that the sport has been largely affected by the coronavirus which has made it almost impossible for them to host any competitions. “The athletes were not training properly due to the closure of gyms and we were unable to host the Zim National tourney a few months ago,” he said.
