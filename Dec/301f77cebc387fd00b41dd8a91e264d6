 By Emmerson Njanjamangezi THE government yesterday announced a new set of charges to be paid in forex for ex-Japanese vehicle imports in the form of radiation contamination inspection fees with immediate effect. In a notice to vehicle importers, the Radiation Protection Authority of Zimbabwe (RPAZ) said it was now a requirement for importers to pay for radiation inspection and decontamination of vehicles. The radiation inspection fees for light motor vehicles and minibuses were pegged at US$10 while buses, heavy vehicles, haulage trucks and trailers would pay US$20. De-contamination fees for light vehicles and minibuses were pegged at US$50, while buses, heavy vehicles, haulage trucks and trailers would pay US$100. Japan is still feeling the impact of the Fukushima nuclear disaster when a tsunami triggered explosions at the Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011. The wind carried radioactive material for kilometres, covering whole towns and neighbourhoods with dangerous, yet invisible, particles. “RPAZ wishes to inform you that it is now a requirement in terms of Statutory Instrument 281 of 2020 titled Radiation Protection (Safety and Security of Radiation Sources) (Amendment) Regulations, 2020 (No 5), that all vehicles being imported into Zimbabwe from countries that experienced nuclear incidents (Japan) be inspected for radiation contamination with immediate effect,” read part of the notice. The introduction of the new fees follows an announcement by RPAZ last week that it would be monitoring vehicles being imported into the country to assess radiation contamination. “This is standard practice meant to enhance the safety of the people against possible exposure to radiation and is done for imports from countries that have experienced nuclear disasters,” RPAZ said in a statement. RPAZ added that monitoring teams would be deployed at the countries’ ports of entry to monitor the vehicles being
imported into the country. “If any are found to be contaminated, these will be isolated and decontaminated on site in line with SI 281 of 2020 (Radiation Protection Safety and Security Amendment Regulations 2020 no. 5),” added RPAZ The authority is a regulatory body established under the Radiation Protection Act with a mandate to protect the people and the environment from the adverse effects of ionising radiation. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); Recently, the government announced a ban on the importation of used vehicles older than 10 years in a bid to revitalise the local automotive industry.
