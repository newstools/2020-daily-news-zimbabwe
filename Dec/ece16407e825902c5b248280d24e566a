 AMNESTY International Zimbabwe has posthumously honoured superstar Oliver “Tuku” Mtukudzi, for producing music that speaks out against genderbased violence (GBV).
Tuku was bestowed the honour at an event at Cresta Lodge Msasa in the capital on Thursday night as the entire world, including Zimbabwe began commemorating 16 Days of Activism Against GBV. The award was presented by veteran actress Jesesi Mungoshi and was received by Tuku’s widow Daisy Mtukudzi and Selmor, his daughter. “Thank you Amnesty International for recognising our hero…Mtukudzi’s work against human rights violations spans decades,” Selmor said. Tuku died last year in January with 66 studio albums under his belt. It was all tears from his family when the award was being presented. After receiving the gong, Selmor and Daisy emotionally hugged each other on the stage. Amnesty International Zimbabwe’s Rose Muzerengi said Tuku was there for the marginalised people and he was proud of that. “Tuku’s music was a symbol of advocacy and his lyrics spoke about justice in all areas of society and at all times. He spoke against colonialism in the 1970s (Zimbabwe and Ndipeiwo Zano). In these tracks he celebrated the local people’s struggle for freedom and called for an end to colonialism. “In the 1980s, it was not unusual for men to beat up their wives. In many situations it was actively encouraged as away of keeping women under control. Artistes of the time released songs that featured beatings and domestic
violence. Mtukudzi released Tozeza Baba, “a lyrically loaded attack on men who come home and beat up their wives,” Muzerengi said. “The song’s words show this was common. Mtukudzi was brave to release this song which criticised drunkenness and wife beating at a time when he played largely in night clubs for drinking men.” Tuku, who was also brand ambassador for Unicef, fought for women and children’s rights through his music and good examples are the songs Neria and Sandi Bonde, among others. “The song (Neria) has lived on long after the movie ended its run and remains one of his most celebrated and covered pieces,” she said. Also honoured at the event were theatre groups and organisations that campaigned against GBV. Those honouredare All Generations Drama Group from Harare, Lambelela Arts Ensemble from Bulawayo, Mutare’s Eastern Arts Ensemble, Pisa Pisa Drama Group from Masvingo, Shamwari Yevasikana and the Zimbabwe Association of Community Radio Stations.
