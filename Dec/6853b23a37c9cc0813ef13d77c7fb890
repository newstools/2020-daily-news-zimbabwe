THE Special Anti-Corruption Unit (Sacu) has commenced investigations into Harare Magistrates’ Courts prosecutor Tapiwa Kasema’s conduct after he consented to bail for alleged notorious armed robber Musa Taj Abdul and his gang. This comes as the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) yesterday suspended Kasema after a huge public outcry following the granting of bail to the murder and armed robberies suspects. Abdul, 47, has been on the police’s most wanted list for the past 20 years and was arrested in August following a shootout with police in Beitbridge. Yesterday, Sacu head Thabani Mpofu could not confirm or deny to the Daily News that Kasema was now under the police radar. Sources in the graft-busting unit in President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s office said he would be arrested soon. “The manner in which the case was handled is highly irregular,” Mpofu said without elaborating. But a source in Mpofu’s office said Kasema would be arrested soon. “We are almost done with the investigation and he (Kasema) will be arrested soon,” the source added. On Monday, Abdul together with his accomplices Godfrey Mupamhanga, 27, Rudolf Tapiwa Kanhanga, 29, and Douglas Mutenda, 31, were granted $5 000 bail each by High Court judge Justice Benjamin Chikowero. In the bail ruling, Chikowero ordered that Abdul resides at number 12 Adams Avenue, St Martins, Harare, until the matter is finalised. He has also been ordered to report once a week at Sunningdale 2 Police Station and not to interfere with witnesses. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); The quartet, however, remained behind bars after police slapped them with fresh charges. Abdul and his gang were allegedly responsible for some of the most notorious armed heists in the country with people losing their lives in some of the incidents. With such an infamous track record and violent streak, most Zimbabweans were flabbergasted by the granting of bail to Abdul and his gang. There has always been a huge suspicion of collusion between Abdul and some members of the police force, which explained why he stayed on the run for such a long period. His luck finally ran out in August this  year when a police crack unit tracked him to his hideout in Beitbridge where the gang was allegedly being harboured at the house of a serving police officer — Tapiwa Mangoma. The gang was finally apprehended after an exchange of gunfire with the police, bringing to an end one of the most protracted manhunts in Zimbabwe’s history. Mangoma was also arrested and charged with harbouring criminals and is currently in remand prison after the High Court denied him bail. Sponsored Links
