 THE government should improve the conditions of service for judicial officers as part of efforts to wipe out corruption within the sector, the Judicial Service Commission(JSC) has recommended. The recommendations are part of JSC’s five-year strategic plan recently launched by President Emmerson Mnangagwa. During the launch, Mnangagwa urged the judiciary to take the lead in fighting the scourge of graft and
commended efforts that were being made to bring corrupt judicial officers, among them magistrates and judges, to book. The president recently fired High Court judge Francis Bere after he had set up a tribunal that found him guilty of corruption before constituting another board to investigate Justice Erica Ndewere. Bere was accused of telephoning Zimbabwe National Roads Administration (Zinara) lawyer Itai Ndudzo of Mutamangira and Associates, asking him to consider settling a civil dispute pitting Zinara and Fremus Enterprises, allegedly owned by the judge’s relatives. “The JSC will intensify its anticorruption drive within the judicial system. One approach that participants advocated for was to improve the conditions of service for judicial staff such that they are not easily corruptible,” reads the strategic plan. “However, it was highlighted that all members of the judiciary and the JSC need to live by the values of integrity and transparency which are shared values within the JSC.” JSC also noted how youthful magistrates were more susceptible to corruption and moved to review the minimum age requirements for one to qualify for the profession. “ A study has revealed that there is a high correlation between age and corruption…showing that the younger magistrates who are usually lowest paid tend to be more susceptible to corruption,” JSC said. “Participants recommended that the JSC reviews the minimum age criteria for the recruitment of magistrates. The JSC will strengthen efforts to address these issues in the next planning cycle.” The commission also observed that understaffing and excessive workloads had created a loop-hole for corrupt activity and said routine assessments would be made. “Excessive workloads per capita were unsustainable and resulted in bottlenecks, backlogs and delays in the delivery of justice. The rationalisation of workload and elimination of bottlenecks will aid the fight against corruption as heavy workloads may be used to mask corrupt activities while bottlenecks and backlogs create opportunities for rent-seeking behaviour,” JSC added. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); “The JSC will undertake workload and staffing needs assessment to determine optimum staff establishment, recruit and deploy as appropriate.” Sponsored Links
