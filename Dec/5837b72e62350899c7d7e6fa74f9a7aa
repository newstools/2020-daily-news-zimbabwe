 FIVE armed robbers ambushed and attacked a cash-in-transit vehicle carrying at least US$35 000 meant for a Mukuru outlet in Chivi on Monday in a daring heist that has left the police astonished. This comes as the police have in recent weeks been alerted to a number of heists involving cash-in-transit vehicles and violent home break-ins targeting business people, who normally keep cash in their homes. Mukuru is a money transfer agency which allows Zimbabweans to receive foreign currency from the diaspora which has numerous outlets and kiosks dotted around the country, making the firm a prime target of robbers. “The police are investigating an armed robbery case which occurred at N. Richards, Chivi, on November 30 at about 0934 hours when five unknown suspects armed with pistols ambushed Safe-Guard cash-in-transit vehicle delivering cash at Mukuru and attacked them. “The robbers pointed firearms at the security guards as they were disembarking from the vehicle and disarmed them before stealing a cash box containing US$35 000, ZAR350 000 and $2 000 from the vault. “They jumped into an unregistered blue Toyota Revo twin cab which was used as a gate away car and sped off towards Mandamabwe Business Centre. The suspects also robbed three Star pistols from the guards,” national police spokesperson Paul Nyathi said yesterday. The suspects are still at large and police are appealing to the public for information to assist with investigations. Sponsored Links
