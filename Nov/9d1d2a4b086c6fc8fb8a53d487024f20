 HARARE giants Dynamos have been using the coronavirus (Covid-19) downtime to ensure they move towards professionalism and attain a Club Licensing certificate, the Daily News reports.
Club Licensing regulations ensure that football teams have sound organisation on five fronts; sporting, infrastructure, administrative and personnel, legal and finance. Once a club has sound structures in all these areas, this will improve their level of competitiveness and professional integrity. At the moment, reigning champions FC Platinum are the only Zimbabwean club that has received their
Club Licensing certificate from Caf after meeting all the requirements. This has been a great indictment on tradition giants Dynamos, Highlanders and CAPS United, who have failed to be the torch bearers for local football in terms of professionalism. As the country’s biggest and most successful club, the Glamour Boys have over the years been accused of failing to lead the way both on and off the pitch. The Glamour Boys do not have a training facility or a stadium of their own as they have to rent facilities. Even with a huge following across the country which at one time was estimated to be in the region of seven million, DeMbare
do not have a club store where they can sell official merchandise and leverage on their multitude of fans. However, DeMbare spokesperson Tinashe Farawo said the Harare giants are slowly moving in the right direction in meeting the Club Licensing requirements. Last year, the Glamour Boys appointed former Zifa chief executive officer Jonathan Mashingaidze to take up a similar role at the club and head the secretariat. At the beginning of this year, the Harare giants also received sport science equipment from their Belgian partners and are in the process of hiring competent staff to lead their performance department. Earlier this week, the Harare giants appointed broadcaster Yvonne Mangunda to lead their communications and marketing department. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); “In fact, you are going to see more crucial appointments to strengthen our secretariat. “What we are looking
at is to conform to club licensing requirements. “It’s a process and we are glad we are slowly getting there,” Farawo told the Daily News. Last year, the Harare giants entered into a lucrative sponsorship deal with Golden Leaf Tobacco (GLT) through their brand Remington Gold. With the backing of their sponsors, DeMbare were the leading spenders in the transfer market before the 2020 season was halted by Covid-19. Coach Tonderai Ndiraya brought in at least 14 new players as he embarked on a complete rebuild after
an underwhelming 2019 campaign in which they finished in ninth place. DeMbare signed Partson Jaure, Byron Madzokere, Sylvester Appiah, Nkosi Mhlanga, Taimon Mvula, Tino Chiunye, Takunda Mawarire and Barnabas Mushunje. The other new players they brought in for the 2020 season are Lennox Mutsetse, Tanaka Chidhobha, Juan Mutudza, Albert Eonde, King Nadolo and David Temwanjira. Most of these players agreed one-year contracts and received signing-on fees averaging between US$4 000 and US$5 000. “I can tell you that we are on a business trajectory and we shall strive to turn the club into a business partner of choice through embracing best practices. “We believe that we should frontline the thrust to embrace professionalism through the Fifa Club Licensing framework. “We would like to be the champions of the best practices in Zimbabwean football, making our club an attractive investment partner,” Farawo added.
