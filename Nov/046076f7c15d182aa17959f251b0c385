 ZIMBABWE has a unique and uncharted electoral terrain for a country in the nascent phases of electoral democracy. It is a country in perpetual electoral mode unprecedented in the southern Africa region, holding the record for the most highly contested elections. Most, if not all, of the elections held in Zimbabwe since the 80s have been heavily contested and characterised by violence, culminating in the legitimacy of those elected being called into question. Not only have elections been characterised by violence, but also by an unequal playing field and selective application of laws. Laws have been crafted that do not mirror international and regional standards governing the conduct of elections. The upcoming 2023 elections, if conducted properly, provide an opportunity to advance the democratic process in the country, but this can only happen if meaningful changes to the electoral landscape are introduced. To this end, the CSOs in the country have a role to play in ensuring the electoral architecture allows for free and equal participation by all citizens in elections. Ultimately this will help prevent  what James Madison called the tyranny of the majority, which seem to be emerging in the country now. Leading Zimbabwe election oversight organisations such as the Zimbabwe Election Support Network (Zesn) and the Election Resource Centre (ERC) have driven the agenda for electoral reforms through the publication of policy briefs, position papers on electoral reforms as well as petitions to Parliament. On September 24, ZESN officially handed over a comprehensive Draft Electoral Amendment Bill to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Justice in which it suggests sweeping electoral reforms. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); Running parallel to these efforts by CSOs, the government set up an inter-ministerial committee to lead political, electoral and legislative reforms in line with recommendations of the Motlanthe Commission of Inquiry into the August 1, 2018 post-election violence. However, this initiative has been criticised for its lack of inclusiveness and its elitist approach to the process of reforming the electoral architecture of the country. CSOs, political parties and other key electoral stakeholders protested their apparent exclusion from the process. Inevitably, the committee is still to table its recommendations and to date no meaningful reforms have been enacted, resulting from this effort almost one-and-a-half years after being set up. It goes without saying that the foregoing efforts, especially those by the CSOs, have contributed to the continuous visibility of the agenda for electoral reforms in the country. However, with the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic, there is incontrovertible evidence that focus has now shifted from the pursuit of electoral reforms towards fighting the scourge. The agenda for electoral reforms appears to have been relegated to the tail end of the important reforms that should be in place prior to the next elections. The ERC, for example, observed in its latest ERC Election Barometer that the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) did not implement much of the needed administrative reforms two years after the 2018 harmonised elections. In his State of the Nation and opening of the third session of the ninth parliament address on October 22, President Emmerson Mnangagwa announced at least 40 pieces of legislation to be tabled in parliament. These range from new bills, amendments and ratification bills and missing is the bill to amend the Electoral Act. The upshot is that the country will most likely go to the 2023 harmonised elections with laws that are not aligned to the Constitution, setting the stage for another contested election. Moreover, the government’s proposed amendments to the Constitution and the enactment of the recently approved “sanction laws” by the Cabinet will further asphyxiate participation by citizens in both the political and electoral processes of the country. The focus for reform should now be on attending to essential reforms that improve political representation, political legitimacy and political inclusion such as the review of all legislation that has a bearing on the political and electoral environment, and in turn on the electoral process and results thereof. In addition to this, extending the franchise and the right to vote to all citizens of Zimbabwe, regardless of where they are domiciled in the world is prudent for the electoral inclusion agenda. The reform agenda should also focus on reforms to improve coherence and sufficiency of electoral laws, especially the alignment of the electoral laws to the Constitution and enforcing laws such as the Traditional Leaders Act and Constitutional provisions on neutrality of traditional leaders. Additionally, reforms to improve impartiality, effectiveness and credibility of election administration and management such as enhancing the independence of the Zec should be prioritised. Changes to provisions relating to voters’ registration and the voters’ roll to ensure they enhance the credibility of Zimbabwean elections should be vigorously pursued. Similarly, efforts should be directed at improving the role of Zec in electoral boundary delimitation. It is given the country’s electoral landscape is littered with disputes and as such laws designed to strengthen electoral dispute mechanisms should be enacted. Furthermore, focus should now shift towards supporting reforms that enhance civic competence of citizens on electoral matters such as enhancing voter education by creating more space for stakeholders other than Zec to conduct civic and voter education. These are a few of the priority reforms proposed by local, regional, and international observers, including the Monthlate Commission. The list goes beyond these. In periods of social turbulences such as during pandemics, civil society has a unique opening for effective action to ensure free, credible and democratic elections through advocating for electoral reforms. The agenda is no longer about holding regular elections in line with the constitutional provisions but to ensure that the elections are credible. Electoral reforms require a strong and coordinated approach if the momentum that had already been built prior to the advent of Covid-19 is to be sustained. The necessity to have a strong coordinated mechanism that will bring CSOs together in advocating for reforms during the pandemic is indispensable. The country has witnessed half-hearted approaches towards a coordinated framework, with most CSOs and the government pushing the agenda for electoral reforms in silos. What is required now, given the circumstances the country finds itself in, is the setting up of the electoral reforms working group made up of different stakeholders from all sectors of society. These could be from CSOs, Chapter 12 institutions, Law Society of Zimbabwe, and media organisations to name but a few. The strong inter-linkages among civil society locally and nationally will help drive the process in time for the next elections. In this regard, CSOs, as a collective, should continue discussions with relevant legislative committees, political parties and Zec on areas of reform during this pandemic period. To aid the engagement, CSOs are encouraged to develop a harmonised roadmap on electoral reforms taking into consideration long-term and immediate reform needs. This should be supported by engagement with solution holders such as legislators who would be willing to engage with civil society on electoral reforms. Research and analysis on electoral reform issues to provide information to legislators to enable them to make informed decisions should be pursued during this period. Mobilisation of citizens’ participation in the reform process, specifically support to a citizen driven electoral reform process, must be prioritised. More importantly, CSOs should continue to undertake civic education for citizens to understand the reforms and to keep the reforms agenda visible using Covid-19-friendly methods such as radio, TV, social media, and fliers.
