 BEING proud Africans that we are, we would’ve been thrilled to come across a statement like “US president-elect Joe Biden conducted himself professionally in a dignified and calm manner, peculiar to African leaders during elections”. Instead, what we got was a slap in the face. The insinuation that it was outgoing president Donald Trump who “took a leaf out of African leaders’ book” came as a great shock — it was so unexpected. To make it worse, former US Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, compared Trump to Zimbabwe’s late former president Robert Mugabe. Lawyer and former Special Counsel for the United States Department of Justice, Robert Swan Mueller, criticised Trump for acting like Zimbabwe’s opposition. A comedian from South Africa, Trevor Noah, also once joked that Trump may actually be an ideal president for Africa. These remarks are unfair and we deeply resent them. They are quite uncalled for. However, we need to shed off this negative image. We can do that by first asking the man in the mirror (or should I say the African in the mirror?) to change his ways and make it right — take a look at yourself and then make a change. I see, I’ve reminded you of Michael Jackson’s Man in the Mirror. A great song of all time, if you ask me. Oh, yes! Thank you very much. Back to Trump: why would this man, whom the press portrays as having narcissistic personality disorder, be compared to us? We know that narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a personality disorder characterised by a long-term pattern of exaggerated feelings of self-importance, an excessive craving for admiration, and struggles with empathy. Leaders with NPD care mostly about holding on to power and are not concerned about the welfare of other people. Is that what our leaders are like? The media has also alluded to Trump’s strange antics. It said he vowed beforehand to reject the outcome of elections if it went against him and he did not hesitate. Within hours of the end of voting, he falsely claimed to have won, cried foul, alleged grand larceny and fraud. Another trait that Trump has in common with some African leaders is vindictiveness, which has made him appear petty, going after people whom he believed had scorned him, even when it wasn’t in his country’s best interests. For example, he tried to undo Barack Obama’s policies, not because he felt they were wrong, but because he had a bone to pick with him. It has been pointed out that Trump saw all those who opposed him as incapable of thinking, and that only himself was wise. In fact, he intentionally came up with false information, lies, deceptions and insults. Of course, he was not concerned about doing what was good for America as such but what was good for himself and for his cronies who worshipped him. I’m sorry to say this, but these are trademarks of most of our African leaders indeed. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); Trump would go nuts whenever his actions were questioned and would react recklessly — shooting himself in the foot. Need I say more? What I find ironic is that some African Americans despised him and African leaders have hailed Biden on his victory. In what was dismissed as a cheap act, Trump once proclaimed: “I have done more for the African American community than any president with the exception of Abraham Lincoln.” African Americans, including Ben Carson, who was the only African American Cabinet secretary in the Trump administration, refuted the claim. Before playing a clip of former South African President Jacob Zuma making remarks about some, but not all migrants committing crimes Noah said: “… Donald Trump is presidential. He just happens to be … on the wrong continent… In fact, once you realise that Trump is the perfect African president, you start to notice the similarities everywhere, like the level of self-regard,” Noah remarked, playing clips of former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, whose full title was “His Excellency, President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hadji Doctor Idi Amin Dada, VC, DSO, MC, Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Seas and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular.” And Mueller said: “I get the feeling that Trump’s defence is worse for this country. I was reading about Zimbabwe today, and I have been to that country, and I would say it’s a young democracy trying to figure itself out. “Trump is taking us to where they are, where all the opposition does is say … everything is rigged, that everything is not on the level there is no such thing as truth … an opposition which says our side is always right, your side is always wrong.” Having said all this, let’s not lose sight of the fact that Trump managed to garner millions of votes. Maybe there’s a lesson somewhere, although I can’t see it at the moment. Sponsored Links
