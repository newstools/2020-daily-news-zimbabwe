 UNDER-FIRE Zimbabwe cricket interim limited overs captain Chamu Chibhabha feels he will finally get it right with the bat despite an underwhelming performance in the ongoing tour of Pakistan.
After almost seven months of inactivity due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, Chibhabha and his men were
finally able to get back on the field during the series, which began at the end of last month in Islamabad. Pakistan won the ODI series 2-1 after completely dominating in the first two matches before Zimbabwe avoided a
series whitewash with a Super Over win in the final match. However, Chibhabha’s form in those three matches has been the major talking point amongst fans back home after the opening batsman scored a measly 19 runs in the three innings. The right hander scored 13 in the first ODI then six in the second match before being dismissed for a duck in the final encounter. With the ball, the right arm medium seamer bowled for only two overs in the first match going for 16 runs. With the two teams set to continue the series with three T20I matches commencing in Rawalpindi tomorrow, Chibhabha knows his back is against the wall. “It’s great to finally put an end to a 10-game winless streak and put points on the board as we vie for a World Cup place in India 2023. “As captain and opening batter, I always want to lead from the front and help set a launching pad for the team.
“It’s something I am yet to do on this tour. I have been hitting the ball reasonably well in the nets and I feel a big score is around the corner,” Chibhabha said. Sponsored Links
