 By Black Edward RUMBIDZAI Gore was ecstatic after completing four years of a rigorous and demanding degree programme — oftentimes burning the midnight oil. Understandably, it was her desire to host a big celebration party
with all her relatives in attendance.
“I was looking forward to a huge graduation bash, not just for me, but for my whole clan,” she said. “You see, this whole varsity cruise, with its tidal waves, wouldn’t have been successful without the support of my friends and relatives.” True, bearing in mind that Class of 2020 was riddled with misfortunes: high fees, Covid-19, strikes, long breaks, e-learning challenges and virtual graduation ceremonies. “If you ask me, these virtual events are not the real deal. They lack the proper feel and are a pale imitation, not really a replacement,” she added. The government took drastic measures in an attempt to stop Covid-19 spreading, including limiting numbers at gatherings. So there was no hosting of big parties and only a few top students had the honour of being physically capped, with the majority following proceedings virtually. For example, at HIT only 20 outstanding students had the honour of physically attending the ceremony.
Students wanted graduation to be an opportunity to mix and mingle, to savour, to feel their accomplishments and
make it memorable. And the class of 2020’s misfortunes persisted as the new degree holders realised that they had virtually graduated into joblessness, with unemployment rising sharply, most companies retrenching, with endless freezes on recruitments and the economic crisis continuing to worsen. Some other grads felt that it was pointless to throw parties since the future looked bleak — there was nothing to
celebrate. But it should not have been like that. Colleges should have adequately equipped the grads with practical life skills as opposed to focussing on mere
academic excellence — and not to educate them to aspire to be good employees when there were no jobs. Our universities should spare some thought for the country’s progress and invest some time to remove obstacles in our way. When there’s progress jobs will be created. These colleges should do more to prepare students for tough times and the everchanging landscape. It is every citizen’s hope that our education system serves the interests of Zimbabweans. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); Education shouldn’t be just for image enhancing or decoration, it must be functional.  Among other roles, our colleges should continue to foster a job-creator and entrepreneurial mindset in students. “The immediate must-do for our committed Education 5.0 subscribed State universities is adopting and nurturing a
job-creator mode mindset. The job-creator mindset demands close interaction with their host communities to identify economic opportunities to not only inform their curriculum trajectory but, most important, innovation and innovation research and development agenda …,” says the Higher and Tertiary Education ministry. Thank you very much, that’s the way to go — let’s see some action now. The colleges should lean towards modern technological trends, industrialisation, innovation and production and
modernisation. It’s time we stopped importing water chemicals, solar panels, lipstick, number plates, keyboards…the list is endless.
Speaking after Great Zimbabwe University’s 14th graduation ceremony held virtually recently, President Emmerson Mnangagwa said universities should be nerve centres of the drive to accelerate modernisation and industrialisation by coming up with inventions and solutions to challenges afflicting the country. Indeed, academic interventions are crucial in addressing our never-ending crises. For example, corruption has made it difficult for Zimbabwe to develop. This is where our colleges should come in and make education a valuable weapon in the fight against corruption. With proper planning and research anti-corruption education should find its place in tertiary institutions. Remember that startling revelation early this year by an esteemed minister concerning our education system.
The minister criticised Zimbabwe’s higher education system, claiming it was producing more fools than thinkers. “…our education system is teaching people to read and write, but is doing little to teach them to think…,” he was quoted as saying. “With this seemingly ineffective education system that we have, some people end up saying being streetwise is better than going to university because if a grad was prepared for the real world there would be a difference between him and someone with no tertiary education in terms of coping with day to day challenges,” said Rumbidzai dejectedly Sponsored Links
