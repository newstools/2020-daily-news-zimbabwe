ART has over the years played the crucial role of healing and giving hope to troubled souls, artists said, adding that it was also a lubricant during the Covid-19 lockdown period.
This came out during the 3rd National Citizens Convention which started on Wednesday and will run until today. Deliberating on the question; how do we heal the past and access the future through our art that was moderated by
Maaianne Knuth and Undine Whande, musicians Edith WeUtonga and Mabel Sithole revealed that art cures society
in trying times. “Music played a crucial role during the lockdown period and even before. It consoles the depressed and gives hope to the hopeless. “There is a girl who was being abused and everyone in her family treated her like an outcast. “She told me how music
comforted her when everyone was castigating her,” WeUtonga said. Sithole, who is based in South Africa, revealed that creating music is a healing process on its own. “Art is a place where you can dream, visualise and create. This process transforms the way we function. It shifts one’s thinking and it helps us to free ourselves from the past. “Art has the power to unlock the unseen and bring them into a visible and tangible world,” she said. Sithole said artists tend to create their own space away from the crowd during art creation and this has a healing
effect on the creator. “During the process, I love to keep myself away from what keeps me busy or away from the usual pressures. This
includes taking a walk or going away from the city.” She revealed that artists drown their sorrows in their art which keeps them going despite some challenges. “Performing in itself heals the artist. I remember when I met the late Oliver ‘Tuku’ Mtukudzi in Cape Town and he was not looking so good but he kept on laughing. “This helped him in a great way. Despite the challenges that he was facing, he kept going, delivering the message to his fans,” Sithole said. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); WeUtonga concurred with Sithole, adding that the calling goes beyond the body/ vessel’s ability. “I still remember when my son was ill. He was supposed to go for an open heart surgery but I forced myself on stage and delivered the message to my fans,” she said. Sponsored Links
