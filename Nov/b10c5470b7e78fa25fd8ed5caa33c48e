 VIVO Energy Zimbabwe, which distributes and markets fuels, lubricants and liquefied petroleum gas, recently commissioned a world class fully automated high-tech fire system in Harare.
The newly installed system can automatically detect fire and extinguish it without the need for human intervention.
Vivo Energy Zimbabwe managing director Johan Grobbelaar said the commissioning of the system was in line with the company’s ultimate ambition to achieve a world-class safety culture. “Safety is an integral and essential part of everything we do at Vivo Energy and remains an absolute priority across the business for our staff and contractors,” said Grobbelaar. “We continue to ensure that the appropriate personal protective equipment is available and that stringent additional screening, cleaning procedures and facilities continue at our sites and depots to limit the risk of infection.” Sponsored Links
