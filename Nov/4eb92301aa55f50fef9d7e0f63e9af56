  ORGANISERS of the annual Change a Life Concert have lived up to their motto and changed the life of a bed-ridden granny in Mabvuku. Change a Life Concert is the entertainment arm of Alfred Dondo Foundation which was founded in 2014 as a non-profit organisation that assists the underprivileged; starting with 25 children. The foundation has assisted hundreds of people across the country. Annually, the foundation hosts Change a Life Concert in Harare for the benefit of marginalised people. Previously, the event has featured musicians such as South African rapper Nasty C, Nigerian star Davido and King98, among others. On Friday, the foundation partnered Mwanachipo Africa Trust to donate a wheelchair and some groceries to 80-year-old granny Agnes Blackstone, who is a Zambian national. Blackstone, who is a widow and has no child, was involved in an accident 21 years ago in Mabvuku, Harare, a development that saw her legs paralysed. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');});  “Children are a blessing to us. They look after us in our old ages but spare a thought for those people who have no children. What will happen to them in their old age? “As Mwanachipo Africa Trust, we work with a number of companies, including Impala Car Rental, which sponsors the foundation to help these people in our communities,” Mwanachipo executive chairman Heaven Munyuku said. He added that the country is still to come to terms with barrenness. “The failure to conceive a baby is a big problem in Zimbabwe and other parts of Africa. “People will blame you for failing to have a child yet a child is a gift from God. Owing to pressure from relatives and friends, some women end up stealing babies to silence critics.” Alfred Dondo Foundation’s Tracy Ngoma said her organisation is for the less-privileged people. “We are here in Mabvuku to help gogo Blakestone because she is our mother. As an organisation, we have a soft spot for the elderly and children.” Prior to the Mabvuku donation, the foundation donated food hampers to a dozen  retired Sally Mugabe Hospital (formerly Harare Hospital) employees.
