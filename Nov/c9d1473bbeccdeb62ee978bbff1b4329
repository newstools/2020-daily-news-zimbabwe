 ALFRED Dondo Foundation (ADF), the organisers of the annual Change a Life concert, has presented aspiring musician Gloria Dzorwa with an early birthday present. Dzorwa, who was born on November 14 in 1992, has spinal cord problems and cannot walk or use her hands since birth due to the condition. And on Friday, the foundation gifted her with a wheelchair and groceries in Domboshava. “She (Gloria) is my late sister’s child and I am staying with her and taking care of her with the assistance of my wife. “Her father abandoned her at a very early age because of her condition. We do not know his whereabouts. “No one wants to associate with her because of her condition and we really thank the foundation for boosting her spirits,” her uncle, Arthur Dzorwa, said. Gloria said since she cannot walk or use her hands to earn a living, she wants to be a singer. “I would love to be a singer and I am optimistic this will be possible if I get an opportunity to get into the recording studio,” she said.  ADF’s Tracy Dondo said they will continue to help Gloria with the “little” things she needs. “It is our hope that this relationship will continue. We also encourage other partners or well-wishers to assist Gloria as we all deserve to be happy in life,” she said. The donation comes as the foundation is intensifying efforts to uplift marginalised people in communities. Recently, the foundation donated a wheelchair and groceries to Zimdancehall chanter Michoe Bacho in Chitungwiza. The foundation is also organising the launch of Allan Chimbetu’s Urgent Matter album on November 14. It will be launched live on State broadcaster ZBC TV and social media platforms. The album, recorded at House of Groove studios, is made up of 10 songs including the title track Urgent Matter, Sorry, Chikubiro, Mudzimai Akarongeka, Kombe (Mambure) and Nhodzerai, among others. The ADF assistance in communities comes at a time when the majority of artists have been reduced to charity cases due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Sponsored Links
