THE rains will soon be upon us and it is worrying that social services in the capital city, Harare, have been neglected.
Over the years we have noted with concern the crumbling social amenities. Lack of maintenance, as a result of financial constraints faced by the city council as most residents are not paying rates and service charges on time, has made the situation worse. It’s high time the city council, with the assistance of the central government, fixes problems in the capital. With the rains around the corner, the city’s drainage system needs to be fixed to prevent flooding each time there is a downpour. Many motorists have been victims as their cars were submerged or stalled in the middle of the road owing to exhaust pipes that filled with water affecting the mechanical system of the vehicle. Most of the streets are pot-holed. Worse still, when it rains, the potholes are covered with water and vehicles plunge in with catastrophic results. Human life will be put under threat. Most street lights have not been working for years now, making residents vulnerable to attacks in the dark by thugs, robbers and street kids. Vendors dealing in foreign currency, selling airtime and other goods gather on every street corner and on pavements, obstructing free movement of people. Yet their activities go unchecked by city authorities. Commuter omnibus operators are slowly returning to the central business district despite that they remain banned by the government. They are touting for passengers at any point they feel like. The city health department seems to be almost defunct. There is no refuse collection in most suburbs and residents have resorted to dumping rubbish anywhere. Water supplies are erratic. The city is always under threat of a typhoid outbreak. It is incumbent upon council and government to find ways to resolve all these problems facing the capital. Residents must chip in by paying rates and service charges on time. Without financial resources, the capital will turn into a garbage city. City fathers should all channel their energies to improving service delivery, not involving themselves in graft as seen by the recent arrest of councillors and senior employees on allegations of corruption involving shady allocation of land.
