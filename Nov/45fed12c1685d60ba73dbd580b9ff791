  A TRAVEL corridor, also known as an air bridge, allows passengers to travel on certain routes to and from countries and territories with low Covid-19 infection rates without needing to quarantine. Travel corridor agreements can be formed between two or more countries. The UK travel corridor list, as of October 18, 2020, has 56 countries. No African country has been included on the list since the UK introduced travel corridors in July. As a result, there are growing calls from various governments and other stakeholders around the world for the UK government to now establish travel air corridors with African countries with low rates of Covid-19 in a bid to revive much-needed tourism. A petition calling for a review of the travel corridor list to countries, in line with the same metrics used for the rest of the world, has been launched by the Africa Travel and Tourism Association. The UK government is obliged to respond when the petition reaches 10 000 signatures. What remains unclear is why no African country is not on the travel corridor list when the total number of confirmed Covid-19 positive cases for the whole African continent is 1 518 662 as of October 6, 2020, with the death toll reaching 36 921 (Africa CDC, 2020). This is in contrast to the UK with a total number of positive Covid-19 positive cases nationwide reaching 705 428 and the death toll reaching 43 579 as of October 18, 2020. It is hard to see why some African countries are being excluded from the UK travel corridor list when they have relatively fewer infections and deaths. The call for African countries to be included on the UK corridor list has been bolstered by the fact the African continent’s infection rates have been on the decline over the past two months even though, admittedly,  testing still remains a challenge in African countries. For example, Chad carries out 383 tests per million, the Democratic Republic of Congo conducts 467 tests per million and Niger performed 373 tests per million. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); As of August 4, 2020, Zimbabwe had conducted four tests per one thousand people in comparison to 52 and six tests per thousand in South Africa and Kenya, respectively. The UK, on the other hand, has carried out more than 205 000 tests per million people (IRC, 2020). In view of the foregoing, African countries need international support to increase their testing capacity, but it is fair to say many African countries are taking decisive public health measures to guarantee the safety of their citizens. Further measures are being developed by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and prevention, in collaboration with the AU Commission. One initiative that has been launched is an online verification platform, My Covid-19 Pass Tool. The platform aims to simplify verification of public health documentation for travellers during exit and entry into countries. It also provides travellers with information on what they need when travelling from their specific port of origin to their destination. It also lists testing centres and creates electronic health cards using downloadable mobile applications that travellers can use across borders. Countries that have adopted this initiative include Ethiopia, Egypt, Cape Verde, Ghana, Togo, Senegal, Ivory Coast, South Africa, Rwanda, Morocco, Liberia, Uganda and Namibia. Similarly, the UK has introduced a Passenger Locator Form (PLF) which travellers need to complete before arrival into the country. Unlike the automated My Covid Tool, upon launch it was immediately apparent to the industry and travellers that the PLF process needed to be significantly improved as travellers were finding it difficult to locate and complete the form. Following some feedback, a small number of changes were implemented. If the debate is to be moved forward, a better understanding of travellers’ health information needs to be developed. Africa, which has 17 percent of the world’s population, has 3.5 percent of the global total deaths from Covid-19 yet no single African country is on the UK travel corridor list. It is time for a rethink!

And furthermore, the assessment can occur before travel begins. A  mix of socio-ecological factors such as low population density and mobility, hot and humid climate, lower age group, interacting to accentuate their individual effects, are likely contributing to the low infection rates and deaths in Africa (WHO Africa,2020). According to the World Health Organisation, “The gradual lifting of travel measures (or temporary restrictions) should be based on a thorough risk assessment, taking into account country context, the local epidemiology and transmission patterns, the national health and social measures to control the outbreak, and the capacities of health systems in both departure and destination countries, including at points of entry”. Africa, which has 17 percent of the world’s population, has 3.5 percent of the global total deaths from Covid-19 yet no single African country is on the UK Travel Corridor list.
