TO THINK we began 2020 supposing the US presidential election would be the foremost news event of year: the story that would monopolise our journalistic attention; the travelling carnival that would see us clocking up tens of thousands of miles; the democratic spectacle that would distance us from our families.
As we entered election year, the main health story to intrude on the campaign was the cardiac condition of Bernie Sanders, the 78-year-old candidate who had suffered a heart attack while campaigning in Las Vegas. Then there was the question of whether Joe Biden had the stamina to cope with the relentless schedule of the round-the-clock campaign. In a field crowded with 70-something politicians, the mortality of the leading candidates became a legitimate subject for discussion. Four years ago, the political genius of Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan was that it became a sentimental catch-all. Rather than sketching out a timeline himself, he let voters decide for themselves when America had last been great. This gave his supporters the historic licence to conjure up kingdoms of the mind, places that sometimes existed only in the abstract. For some, American greatness was found in the Reagan years of the 1980s, the era of resurgence after the long national nightmare of Vietnam, Watergate and the Iranian hostage crisis. In the final weeks of this campaign, however, Trump has been more specific. He has pin-pointed a date. He has told us where to travel back in time. For a time, his campaign toyed with the new slogan Make America Great Again Again. But it sounded more like a taunt — a reminder of the here and now, and how his mishandling of Covid-19 has come to imperil his presidency.
Trump has wrapped himself in the mantle of a wartime president, but in a battle that America
quickly started to lose. — BBC Sponsored Links
