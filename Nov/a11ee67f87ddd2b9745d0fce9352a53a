 Dakarai Mashava SPECIAL FEATURES EDITORmashavad@dailynews.co.zwFINANCE minister Mthuli Ncube is expected to provide much-needed clarity on Zimbabwe’s national economic priorities and growth prospects for the coming year at the Daily News Post-National Budget Business Breakfast Forum to be held at Rainbow Towers in the capital next Monday. Ncube, who will be the guest of honour and keynote speaker, will share the podium with Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor John Mangudya at the event that traditionally attracts the who is who from Zimbabwe’s business circles.The forum, to be moderated by prominent Harare lawyer, Nqobile Munzara, will take place four days after the delivery of the highly-anticipated 2021 National Budget.To help unpack the national budget and its significance on the country’s economy, the organisers of the event have put together a panel of eminent economists and businesspersons.The panellists will include Institute of Chartered Accountants of Zimbabwe (Icaz) chief executive Gloria Zvaravanhu, Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries president Henry Ruzvidzo, Bankers Association of Zimbabwe president Ralph Watungwa and veteran economist Naome Chakanya from the Labour and Economic Development Research Institute of Zimbabwe.Other industrial and commercial representative bodies such as the Chamber of Mines of Zimbabwe and the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce will also be represented.The Associated Newspapers of Zimbabwe (ANZ) — publishers of the Daily News and the Daily News on Sunday — are hopeful that the breakfast meeting will give an accurate dashboard and projection of the economy for 2021.“The post-budget interface is coming at a time Zimbabwe has just launched an ambitious economic blueprint — the National Development Strategy (NDS1) — whose key deliverable is a sustained national economic growth for our country.“Given that NDS1 is a key step in Zimbabwe’s drive to achieving an upper middle-income economy status in the next decade, we are confident that the business forum will provide a platform to share perspectives that will improve the performance of our economy, and the well-being of our citizens,” said ANZ commercial director Lewis Chikurunhe.With Finance minister Ncube and RBZ governor Mangudya set to lead discussions at the event with the help of a panel of experienced economists and businesspersons, Chikurunhe has described the forum as ‘‘a must-attend.”“It is an event not to be missed by business leaders and policy-makers alike.“We are also inviting advertisers to take advantage of the virtual platform to market their products and reach a wider audience,” said Chikurunhe.
