 Blessings Mashaya SENIOR STAFF WRITER mashayab@dailynews.co.zw THE government will soon establish an independent commission to investigate complaints against members of the security sector after the Cabinet yesterday agreed on the principles for the Zimbabwe Independent Complaints Commission Bill. Speaking during yesterday’s post-Cabinet media briefing, Information minister Monica Mutsvangwa said the move was in line with the country’s Constitution. “Cabinet considered and approved the principles for the Zimbabwe Independent Complaints Commission Bill as presented by the minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs (Ziyambi Ziyambi). The objective is to provide for the establishment and function of the Zimbabwe Independent Complaints Commission, thereby operationalising Section 210 of the Zimbabwe Constitution, which says an ‘Act of Parliament must provide an effective and independent mechanism for the receiving and investigating complaints from the public about misconduct on the part of members of the security services, and for remedying any harm caused by such conduct’. Turning to another issue, Mutsvangwa said nurses who were defying the government’s directive banning the ‘flexi hours’ regime in public health facilities would face disciplinary action. “Unfortunately some nurses have continued to defy the government directive banning ‘flexi hours’. The various nurses’ labour organisations comprising the Zimbabwe Nurses Association, Confederation of Nurses Association, Theatre Nurses Association and the Nurses Educators Association met with the Health Services Board and it was resolved to comply with the government directive, save for the Zimbabwe Nurses Association. A total of 1 280 nurses failed to heed the call to return to normal working hours. “The Health Services Board has started instituting disciplinary hearings for the defiant nurses.” She also said they would not reverse the ban on flexi hours. “At its 38th  meeting held on 28 October, 2020 Cabinet was informed that the Zimbabwe Nurses Association openly challenged the Cabinet decision on the cancellation of the flexi-working arrangement and defied the secretary for Health and Child Care’s directive for the association to reverse its statement. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); “Cabinet resolved to cancel the flexi-hours arrangement and that nurses who fail to report for duty be subjected to disciplinary processes; that daily attendance registers for nurses be submitted to the Health Services Board and the Ministry of Health and Child Care head office; and that nursing services be restructured to be supported by three pillars namely contract workers, Health Service Permanent Workers and secondment from the uniformed forces.” She also added that Cabinet approved a Zimbabwe National Human Settlements Policy. “The policy is guided by and seeks to inform implementation of the relevant aspects of Agenda 2030 (Sustainable Development Goals), the African Union Agenda 2063, Zimbabwe’s Vision 2030, the national Constitution and national and international resilience frameworks. “The policy will introduce a raft of changes that will ensure that planning, development and management of settlements are in line with national and international disaster risk reduction frameworks, and with environmental and climate change policies, laws and standards. This will help address the huge housing and social amenities backlog as well as widening disparities between rural and urban areas. It is also expected to reduce the high costs of building materials and housing finance,” she said. Sponsored Links
