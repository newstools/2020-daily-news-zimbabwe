 GOSPEL musician Stanley Gwanzura aka Pastor G has attacked material wealth and love for earthly things in a
new single to celebrate his 50th birthday.
The song is titled Versace neBhachi. “Reaching 50 is testimony that God still loves me. Some of my friends have died
but I am grateful that I am still alive. As a result, I have released this song to educate the world to focus on eternal things. For us to have eternal life, we must always stay in God’s kingdom,” Pastor G told the Daily
News yesterday. Born in Lusaka in Zambia, Pastor G said Versace neBhachi is a metaphor which represents material things. “All those fine things we strive to have during our lifetime are all vanity. True wisdom lies in seeking God’s kingdom,”
he said. The former Ellis Robins High student has 12 studio albums under his belt. “I developed a passion for music at a tender age. I was a member of the school choir. I decided to venture into gospel
music after I finished my Advanced Level,” he said. Pastor G’s music is centred on giving hope to poverty stricken Zimbabweans. Some of his songs include Zvichanaka and Zita RaJesu, among others. Pastor G, who is celebrating 20 years in the music industry, recently released an autobiography titled Indestructible Lessons on Life and Music from my Journey — a reflection on the journey the musician has travelled so far. Prior to the book, Pastor G shared “some personal life lessons” through a musical album Legacy 1610 which is his
10th offering. Gwanzura described his two decades in the music industry as “pathetic.” “True gospel musicians are called by
God, they are not motivated by money or other material things hence the gospel music industry is different from other music sectors. “Gospel musicians need to be focused if they want to remain relevant in the industry. There is no money in gospel music,” he said. Sponsored Links
