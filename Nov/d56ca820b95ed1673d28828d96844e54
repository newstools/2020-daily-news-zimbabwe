 By Pepertua Rojasi EDUCATION minister Cain Mathema has pleaded with Treasury to allocate enough funds for his ministry in the
2021 National Budget to enable it to provide quality learning, inclusive and competence driven infant, junior, secondary and non-formal education.
Speaking during the prebudget seminar with MPs in Harare yesterday, Mathema said his ministry was hopeful that it would get enough financial resources to discharge its mandate. “In view of the need for more teaching and learning space it is hoped that funds will be made available early in
2021 so that the budget can be utilised and construction of schools will commence by the beginning of February 2021,” Mathema told legislators. “The ministry of Primary and Secondary Education is working in collaboration with the ministry of Energy and
Power Development to increase electricity supply in schools which will result in effective teaching of ICT, agriculture and basic skills subjects such as food technology, bakery, wood technology and building technology.” He said the education ministry intended to employ all graduates of teachers colleges. “We also have over 20 000 teachers out there and indeed President (Emmerson) Mnangagwa has indicated the
need for us to employ every graduate so they need to go to work and the government too has to increase the education budget even though it has been increased to $53,9billion for 2021 ”said the education
minister. He urged the government to timeously release grants to fund universal free basic education, a development which he said would reduce the burden of school fees on parents and promote school growth. Meanwhile, speaking during the same prebudget seminar, Higher and Tertiary Innovation Science and Technology Development, minister Amon Murwira, said the higher education sector should come up with degrees and courses
that respond to the needs of the people. “People need water, shelter, food and security and when it (the higher education sector) reads what people need, then it can coin syllabi to make sure that it then uses those human needs to create an industry. “We expect people when they get out of there, they don’t ask us for things, but rather give us the things because
those are the people that would have had the skills “said Murwira. Sponsored Links
