 ZIFA president Felton Kamambo will now stand trial on November 18 in a matter in which he is accused of bribing 32 councillors to vote him into office during the association’s 2018 elections.
Kamambo won the election after dethroning Philip Chiyangwa, who is the complainant in the case, when he garnered 35 votes while the latter got 24. The trial was supposed to open yesterday but Kamambo’s lawyer Tawanda Zhuwarara instructed by Chenai Gumiro made an application to be provided with further particulars. It emerged yesterday that some of the State witnesses, among them Patrick Hill, Mehluli Thebe and one Madodana mentioned that they received money from all the candidates ahead of the election, among them Chiyangwa and
Omega Sibanda. In the application, Kamambo’s lawyer sought details of the amounts allegedly paid by Chiyangwa to all the voters.
The request was not granted after the prosecution indicated that all the witnesses will be called to testify and the defence will have the opportunity to cross-examine them. Regional magistrate Bianca Makwande then ordered that Kamambo’s defence be provided with some of the requested particulars, among them copies of the results of the elections and a copy of the Zifa regulations which were allegedly violated by Kamambo. The matter was then set down to proceed on November 18. Allegations are that in December 2018, Kamambo offered gifts to the councillors who were to vote in the Zifa congress by sending them money via mobile phone transfer. Among the councillors that he is accused of bribing is the late Willard Manyengavana, Denis Thsuma, Mhloro Tavaziva, Edward Chekure, Kudakwashe Chisango, Andrew Tapela, Stanslous Nyachowe and Brenda Bvudzijena. Kamambo allegedly also sent various amounts of money to Tafadzwa Mujuru, Givemore Chidhakwa, Thomas Marambanyika, Stanley Chapeta, Kudakwashe Remba, Artwell Moyo, Pithias Shoko and Francis Ntuta.
Olivarth Guvuriro, Doubt Ncube, Pervious Mathe, Ropafadzo Matemavi, Beaullar Msarah and Nkosilathi Ncube also allegedly received bribes from Kamambo. The money was allegedly sent to the beneficiaries between December 1 and 16 with the recipients getting amounts ranging from $50 to $400. Sponsored Links
