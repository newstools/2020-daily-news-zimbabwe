 ARTS and media practitioners have come together to form the Content Creators Network of Zimbabwe which will defend creators, promote free expression and grow the digital media industry, the Daily News reports.
The network, which was launched yesterday, is made up of the country’s trailblazing digital platforms including Magamba Network, Bustop TV, Centre for Innovation and Technology (Cite), among others. “The new initiative is a networking platform for Zimbabwean content creators to strengthen the industry and to share content that promotes independent media, social justice and free expression,” network convener and spokesperson Samm Monro aka Cde Fatso said. The network was recently launched online. “We live in a time when content creators have defined the Zimbabwean narrative with ground-breaking corruption exposes and hashtags like #ZimbabweanLivesMatter. “We live in a time when the government is going after journalists and satirists who speak truth to the powers that be — online. Now more than ever we need our content creators, community media groups and alternative media outlets to be united, to support each other and defend free expression,” he said. The network is diverse and includes political satirists, community media voices, fact checkers and digital media organisations. “Our diversity is our strength! The network also includes one of the country’s most dynamic content
creation organisations, Cite. In a democracy it is very important to tolerate diverse opinions and that is what Content Creators Network ZW is striving to promote.” The Content Creators Network of Zimbabwe is a loose network of media organisations that use media for positive social change and will include affiliated content creators, alternative media organisations and grassroots community media initiatives. “The network aims to promote high quality content and promote public interest journalism. It also aims to make Zimbabwe’s online news media a more reliable and credible source of information and an effective watchdog. The organisers of the network will soon be hosting events, training and discussions. It also runs digital campaigns
for free expression,” Cde Fatso said. Sponsored Links
