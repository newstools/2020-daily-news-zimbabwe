 Blessing Masakadza and Blessings Mashaya STAFF WRITERS ZESA yesterday announced another whopping 50 percent increase in electricity tariffs, the third such hike in two months — triggering fears that this will have major negative effects on the country’s stabilising economy, the Daily News reports. This comes as prices of goods and services in the country have been stabilising over the past four months, after the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) introduced a foreign currency auction system in June — which has tamed the once rampant forex black market. “The Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) has adjusted the electricity tariffs by 50 percent. “This is in accordance with the Tariff Award of 2 October 2019, which approved implementation of a monthly tariff indexation formula for changes above 10 percent. “The rates are exclusive of the six percent Rural Electrification Levy and 14,5 percent VAT,” Zesa’s subsidiary ZETDC said yesterday. The tariffs rose from $1,11 for the first 50 kilowatts (kWh) to $1,67 — while the 51kWh to 200kWh band rose from $2,42 up to $3,65 per kilowatt. This means that domestic consumers will now part with $669 for 200kWh, and $1 721 for 300kWh. The 201kWh to 300kWh tariff rose from $6,62 up to $9,92. Tariffs for 300kWh and above rose from $10,38 up to $15,57. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); Economist Gift Mugano warned yesterday that the prices of goods and services in the country were likely to increase as a result of the power tariff increases. “This will be inflationary because energy cuts across the whole chain, including production and distribution. Whether you are in farming or any other sector, energy matters. This will cause inflation. “Our advice to Zesa is that they must make their adjustment at once. If they want to increase their tariffs by 100 percent, they must do it. “This is because businesses will not increase their prices by 50 percent if Zesa increases their tariffs by 50 percent. Naturally, business goes above that because of expectations,” Mugano told the Daily News. He said the tariff increase would also see an increase in employment costs. “The whole chain is going to be affected. Both consumers and businesses are going to be affected. It will hit consumers and employers. The employers have to meet new costs. “In mining, the average electricity cost is 30 percent, and so the cost of producing a bag of cement, for example, will increase. “This makes life difficult for companies because workers will demand more money as they will also want to pay for electricity,” Mugano added. Recently, Zesa increased tariffs twice and the latest increase is the third time in less than two months. This comes as Zesa is pushing for a viable tariff regime which, it argues, will enable it to pay for its power needs without running the risk of being cut off by its suppliers. Zesa has also claimed that so low are the current tariffs that “it was now cheaper to use electricity than firewood and liquid gas”. In January this year, the government announced plans to clear its arrears with Mozambique and South Africa — after securing a US$100 million facility from Afreximbank and reviving a 30-year trilateral agreement with the two neighbouring countries as part of short-term solutions to stabilise local power supplies. The trilateral agreement, that was first signed in 1990, allows Zimbabwe to negotiate for “firm and competitively priced” electricity from Hidroeléctrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB) and Eskom.
