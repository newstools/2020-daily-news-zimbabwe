 Tarisai Machakaire THE Judicial Services Commission (JSC) has been joined to a case in which Harare regional magistrate Bianca Makwande had been personally slapped with costs after she ordered MDC Alliance MP Joana Mamombe to be detained for mental examination.Mamombe is on trial for allegedly falsifying her own abduction and on September 24 was placed in the custody of a superintendent at Harare Remand Prison after Makwande made the ruling, which was later overturned by High Court judge Esther Muremba.Muremba ordered Mamombe’s release from prison and slapped the Prosecutor General’s office and Makwande with costs, prompting the JSC to intervene.“The applicant … is hereby joined as the third respondent. The applicant …is hereby granted leave to file its limited opposing affidavit dealing only with the question of costs within 10 days and thereafter the matter shall proceed,” reads an order by Justice Jetser Charewa.JSC secretary Walter Chikwanha said they wished to be joined to the proceedings for administrative purposes since Makwande had not acted in her individual capacity when she handed down the ruling.“The applicant (JSC) believes that as the employer of all judicial officers in the jurisdiction it must be afforded the opportunity to be heard on the question of costs, to make representations in that regard and to assist the court in arriving at a decision as regards the order of costs sought which protects the interests of the Judicial Services Commission.“The applicant’s interest is limited to the draft order which seeks to depart from the precedent in this jurisdiction by inviting this honourable court to make an order of costs against a judicial officer in respect of conduct that has occurred during the normal course and scope of her employment,” Chikwanha said.In her judgment, Muremba said Mamombe had not done anything to compromise her bail conditions.“Taking into account the circumstances of the case, the court should exercise its discretion judiciously and objectively. In this case, the appellant was already out of custody on bail which she had been granted by this court,” Muremba ruled.  Sponsored Links
