 HARARE giants Dynamos yesterday recorded a positive case after the entire squad and technical team underwent coronavirus (Covid-19) tests in the capital yesterday ahead of the resumption of group training.
Due to Covid-19 protocols, the club did not reveal the identity of the individual when they made the announcement
last night. “As part of preparations for the resumption of team training, Dynamos Football Club today conducted Covid-19 tests on first team players, technical team and the secretariat. “Of the 46 people tested, one was positive for Covid-19. “Relevant authorities have been informed and the club will adhere to government and public health guidelines for the positive individual. “The individual will observe a period of self-isolation in accordance with Covid-19 protocols. “We wish him a speedy
recovery and look forward to welcoming him back at work soon. “We will provide further updates as necessary via Dynamos official communication channels. The team will start
group training on November 10, 2020,” Dynamos spokesperson Yvonne Magunda said in a statement. The testing of the Glamour Boys’ players followed that of Bulawayo giants Highlanders, who became one of the first
teams to have their players tested at the weekend. A number of clubs have also undergone the process and Premier Soccer League chief executive Kenny Ndebele said
once results have been availed, teams will commence group training. “Clubs are free to start training as soon as they are done with all the testing protocols they were given,” Ndebele said. Zifa/PSL medical committee head Edward Chagonda said all clubs have been provided with the necessary equipment. “All the clubs were supplied with the testing equipment last week and some of them have already tested. We are waiting for the returns so that we can take them to the lab for the results,” Chagonda told the Daily News.
Meanwhile, speaking shortly after undergoing the test yesterday, a number of DeMbare players were delighted that group training was on the horizon. Sponsored Links
