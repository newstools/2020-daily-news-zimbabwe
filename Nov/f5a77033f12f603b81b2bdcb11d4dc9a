THREE warrants of arrest for different rape cases have been issued for self-proclaimed prophet Shepherd Bushiri,
who fled South Africa earlier this month.
The three warrants were issued on November 19 by the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court. The warrants relate to two
different cases allegedly registered in 2018, and a third rape case registered in 2020. The Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG) leader denied the rape allegations levelled against him, stating
that the Hawks were “intimidating women” to lay false charges against him. Bushiri’s comments followed an eTV interview with two women who claimed that they were raped by him. It has not yet been determined if these cases are linked to the two women that were interviewed. These latest warrants only add to the legal woes of Bushiri who is currently a fugitive as he and wife, Mary, skipped the country after being granted bail in a fraud and money laundering case to the tune of R102 million. A warrant of arrest related to this case was authorised by the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court after it was revealed
that Bushiri had returned to his country of birth — Malawi. In leaving South Africa, the Bushiris violated their bail conditions, which included having to report to a police
station twice a week. While it is not yet known how he managed to flee, Bushiri has since tried to justify his violation of bail conditions. Bushiri said he fled the country because he believed
that his life and that of his wife were in danger. Meanwhile, the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria, on November 18, issued warrants for Bushiri and Mary on
another fraud case. “South Africa has initiated legal proceedings to secure the extradition of the fugitives,” Hawks spokesperson Katlego Mogale said in a statement. This matter is being heard in the High Court and relates to allegations that the couple contravened exchange control regulations. The case involves foreign currency worth around R19 million. The trial in this case has been set down for May 31,
