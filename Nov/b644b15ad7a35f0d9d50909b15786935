 EDITOR – As the festive season gets closer with each passing day, it appears there is one group that is perennially battling to survive while others swim in opulence. These glaring inequalities must just end because they reflect badly on humanity. Yes, in life people are exposed to different opportunities, implying that they will end up in different stations in life. The onus, however, is on us to remember that we must look at fellow citizens and how they live. They are not struggling by design but would also want to live better lives. Daily, we see street children hustling for survival, not even sure where their next meal will come from. At times when we see them doing this, we laugh at them and call them names and yet among us there is a mother and father who have failed in their responsibility, while some even dumped children they thought they would not be able to support. Our world would been a better place if only we remember that we have been fortunate to be where we are. Central government must also do even more to ensure those who live on the streets, as well as other poor people, have basic means of survival. The country is resource-rich with vast deposits of precious minerals in the form of diamonds, gold and platinum metals. Zimbabwe has rich soils that can sustain profitable agriculture. The poor and homeless should have ranked top of the government’s resettlement programme list. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); After giving them land, the government was supposed to help them get off the ground through training in farming methods, mechanising their agriculture and funding for seed and fertilisers. They would obviously not fail at all but would emerge as very successful farmers in the long run. Sadly, most of the beneficiaries of the land reform programme are not part of the desperate and homeless. It is those who are well-heeled who ended up getting more than one farm. It is, however, not too late and the government can still revisit its programmes and ensure that the homeless, including street kids, also benefit. Basically, it will be one problem off the list of challenges because at least they will now have not only somewhere to live but also a source of livelihood for their dependents. When we look at our urban streets today, they are teeming with homeless children who, given viable options, would not live there a day longer. They would hurriedly grab the opportunity to live elsewhere, of course, given that the new places will make their lives better. It is not that they are lazy and do not want to work but the options before them are limited in as much as they would want them broadened. In our communities there are a number of us who have the means and while they wait on the government to come up with options for the needy, their philanthropic works must also look at the homeless and the needy. It is our country together and the resources that are found therein must be shared equitably. That has been one of our biggest handicaps — failing to look at those of our own who may need our assistance in order to make their lives a bit better. Who knows the kind of stories those very people may live to tell or the change they can cause in the communities they will eventually live and, of course, the world at large. Njereshoma Musorowehuku.
