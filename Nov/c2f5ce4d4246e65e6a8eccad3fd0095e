 POLICE have raised concern over the number of rape cases that have been recorded over the past month.
The period has seen a spike in the number of juveniles to grown-up women, who have been raped across the country. “Parents and guardians are warned against leaving the girlchild in the company of male relatives. A juvenile ,12, was
raped in Bulawayo on November 2 by her cousin ,24, after her mother had left her with the suspect. The matter was reported to police and the accused was arrested. Investigations are in progress,” national police spokesperson Paul Nyathi said. “Police have noted with concern the sexual abuse of juveniles by perpetrators staying at the same premises with
the victims. In Harare, a tenant raped a 14-year-old juvenile on three different occasions… and the matter came to light when the victim’s sister noticed changes in her behaviour.” The national police spokesperson added that a 16-yearold Beitbridge girl was raped by her cousin ,22, after the two
had gone to a party during the night. According to Nyathi, some of the rape cases are committed during robberies. The national police spokesperson revealed that Leonard Mwale ,24, was arrested on November 4 in connection with a case of rape which occurred on the same day in Chitungwiza. “The complainant, 34, posted a message on whatsapp group seeking help for a stomach ailment on November
4. A group member then connected her to the suspect (Leonard Mwale) who lured her to his home. She was
given a tablet and an injection which rendered her unconscious. She later regained consciousness
and found the suspect in the process of raping her, thereby raising alarm,” Nyathi said. A report was made to police leading to the arrest of the suspect and recovery of various medicines and injections which included promethazim, rabies vaccine, diclotine and oxytoxin among others. To make matters worse, the Police found 10 women waiting to see the suspect who has no medical qualifications.
“Members of the public are warned against divulging their particulars and seeking help through whatsapp groups and visiting self-proclaimed medical practitioners/prophets at their private homes. At the same time, we appeal to anyone who might have been abused in a similar manner by the suspect to report at any nearest police station,” said Nyathi, adding that some of the rape cases were being perpetrated by religious leaders. “Police in Southlea Park, Harare are investigating a case of abuse where a girl aged 17 was raped by an alleged prophet when she had visited the suspect for spiritual healing of her mother who is terminally ill. Prophets / spiritual healers are warned against abusing women and the girl child on the pretext  of spiritual healing.” Sponsored Links
