 THE Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) has launched a domestic tourism campaign, dubbed ZimBho. The campaign is focused on urging residents to rediscover Zimbabwe in a bid to prop up the tourism sector. As part of the campaign, coined ZimBho #IzimYami #Vakatsha, Environment, Climate Change, Tourism and Hospitality Industry minister Mangaliso Ndlovu said the government had exempted VAT on all tourism services for domestic tourists in a bid to reduce the prices of tourism products and services. “In removing VAT, the government had hoped that there would be a corresponding reduction in the cost of hospitality Institutions. “I remain totally concerned that the rates charged by hotels and lodges in Zimbabwe are still very high,” Ndlovu said. He said the government will continue looking at ways to make tourism affordable to nationals and expects to see such incentives translating to price reductions in the sector for the benefit of the domestic market.
