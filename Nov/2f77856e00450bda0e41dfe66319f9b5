 Vasco Chaya ORGANISERS of the annual Worship Experience Concert have resorted to “pay per view” as the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic lockdown on live events continues to affect the arts sector. The next edition of the Worship Experience concert will be held at Rainbow Towers in the capital on January 1 and will be headlined by South African gospel musician Benjamin Dube. “Owing to lockdown measures, we are unable to host a physical event for everyone. Instead, the physical event is only limited to a few people at a cost of US$30 each. “The rest of the people can watch the concert online through pay per view. Tickets for pay per view are pegged at US$2 and they are already selling,” one of the concert organisers, Elton Kurima, said. The Worship Experience Concert is organised annually by Kayse Connect. Some of the local musicians to grace the event include Zimpraise Choir, Janet Manyowa, Takesure Zamar, Michael Mahendere, Charles and Olivia Charamba, Tembalami, Mathias Mhere, Sabastian Magacha and Takudzwa Chihambakwe. “We are going to host the physical event in line with the rules of the Covid-19 national lockdown. We are going to sanitise people, people will keep a recommended social distance and we will impose a ‘no mask no entry’ rule to curb the spread of the virus. “The few people who will be able to attend the event will get an opportunity to interact, mix and mingle with the musicians,” he said. Meanwhile, Dube whose accolades include the Gospel Legend Award, Best Song of Praise in 2008 and Best Worship Album in 2007 among others is not new to Zimbabwe. In 2014, the South African international musician-cum-pastor and El shaddai Adonai star who boasts over 15 studio albums including Healing in His Presence among others showcased at Walter Magaya’s Prophetic Healing and Deliverance (PHD) Ministries-organised Night of Turnaround 3 in the capital. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');});  He has more than 30 years of experience in the music industry. For the past three decades Dube has worked with a number of popular musicians such as Judith Sephuma, Pastor Meyi Zimu, Solly Mahlangu, Avante, Rebecca Malope and Sechaba among others.
