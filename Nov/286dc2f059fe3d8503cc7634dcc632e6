Vasco Chaya LIFESTYLE WRITER chayav@dailynews.co.zw PARTS of Harare temporarily came to a standstill yesterday afternoon as residents came in their hundreds to witness the late Genius “Ginimbi” Kadungure’s funeral service at the Doves funeral parlour. There was chaos and commotion around the funeral parlour with his followers pushing and shoving to catch a glimpse of proceedings. Before that there were anxious moments when a road show meant for his fans, which included some of his posh cars, took a nasty turn when Ginimbi’s Ferrari overheated at around midday near the corner of Herbert Chitepo Avenue and Sam Nujoma Street in Harare. One of his friends Tinotenda “DJ Rimo” Marimo, who was driving the Ferrari, was forced to abandon the car in the middle of the road for fear it could burst into flames. The unfortunate incident continued to fuel speculation, considering that Ginimbi’s Royce Rolls also caught fire after it hit a tree on the day he died. Apart from the chaos at Doves, there was also drama at Ginimbi’s Dreams Night Club, located just a few kilometres from the funeral parlour, as his followers lined up the streets in anticipation of catching a glimpse of the casket with his remains. Some of his fans were high up in trees as they wanted to get a clear view of the procession. Ginimbi was known as a man of style, classy and full of drama.  Meanwhile, Doves Funeral Services has said it will assist with the burial of the late socialite and fitness enthusiast Mitchelle “Moana” Amuli, who died in the same accident that killed Ginimbi. Amuli, who featured on several local music videos, including Jah Prayzah’s Munyaradzi, was coming from Dreams Night Club where a birthday bash had been thrown for her. Moana is expected to be buried in two weeks’ time when her DNA results are out as she was burnt beyond recognition. Doves added that they decided to assist in the burial of Moana as part of their corporate social responsibility. “Since it was a tragedy, we have decided to assist in her burial. Some well-wishers have paid part of the burial expenses and Doves will cater for the other part,” Innocent Chuma, Doves Group public relations manager told the Daily News. Moana, who died in the accident minutes after celebrating her 26th birthday, is expected to be buried at Zororo Memorial Park near Chitungwiza. On the other hand, Ginimbi is expected to be buried today at his Domboshawa home. Tragedy struck in the wee hours of Sunday morning after Kadungure’s fancy Rolls Royce veered off the road and crashed into a tree along Borrowdale Road in Harare before it caught fire. Residents of the neighbourhood rushed to the scene and managed to retrieve Kadungure from the wreckage while efforts to help the other three occupants who were trapped in the car were fruitless as the car burst into flames, frustrating all rescue efforts.
