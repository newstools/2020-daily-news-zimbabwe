 REPORTS that the MDC led by Thokozani Khupe has started low-level talks with Zanu PF to negotiate the formation of a government of national unity (GNU) must be welcomed by all well-meaning Zimbabweans yearning for social development in the country.
There has been growing pressure for an all-inclusive dialogue locally and abroad to put an end to the political cacophony that has been with us for decades now, which has resulted in economic stagnation that has spewed abject poverty among citizens. The unnecessary political gymnastics between protagonists can and will only be ended by a genuine, transparent and all-inclusive dialogue, whose offspring must be a GNU with a specific mandate to establish strong institutions and entrench democracy in the country. Only strong institutions can undertake prudent political and economic reforms devoid of political expediency of any political party or interest group. Interviews by this newspaper on Wednesday with ordinary people reflected that Zimbabweans are desperately yearning for an end to the political discombobulation that is rife in the country, which has made their lives unbearable. The people were crystal clear, politicians must subordinate their personal interests and beliefs and form a GNU to rescue the country and put it on the path to progress. They experienced how a GNU functions between 2009 and 2013 when the late former president Robert Mugabe and the late MDC founder Morgan Tsvangirai formed a coalition government after the disputed presidential election of the previous year. The coalition government turned around a comatose economy and brought smiles to the faces of citizens. Citizens are nostalgic about it and yearn for a GNU again. President Emmerson Mnangagwa should take heed of the peopleâ€™s pleadings and seriously pursue the need for a GNU. The sooner the better for the country! We said it and we will continue to do so, the country needs unity of purpose, shared vision and values to extricate the country from the doldrums. The forward looking trajectory can become a reality only when the political gladiators stop wasting
away valuable time in power contestations and focus on the key policy issues. We need as a nation to immediately find common ground irrespective of political differences if we are
to move our country forward. The interests of the common people should be respected. Zimbabweans can only reclaim their rights if a GNU is set up. Sponsored Links
