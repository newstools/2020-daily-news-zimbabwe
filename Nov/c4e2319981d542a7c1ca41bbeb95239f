 Vasco Chaya LIFESTYLE WRITER chayav@dailynews.co.zw SOCIALITE Genius Kadungure, popularly known as Ginimbi, died together with three passengers yesterday morning after his vehicle burst into flames following a horrific crash in Harare, the Daily News reports. The flamboyant businessman, known for his colourful and often controversial life, was only 36. Kadungure was travelling from a friend’s party in the capital to his home in Domboshava when his Rolls Royce Wraith collided with a Honda Fit — resulting in him losing control of the car. His vehicle hit a tree before bursting into flames along Borrowdale Road, near Philadelphia School. “The accident happened between 5am and 6am. Kadungure was travelling from Harare toward Domboshava. “His Rolls Royce collided with a Honda Fit. It then hit a tree before it caught fire. He was travelling with three other people who all died on the spot. “Those in the Honda Fit were injured,” national police spokesperson Paul Nyathi told the Daily News yesterday, amid suggestions that Kadungure had been speeding. “Motorists should always be cautious on the roads. They should avoid speeding to save human lives,” Nyathi said. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); Ginimbi’s’s father, Anderson Kadungure, told the Daily News that speeding claimed the life of his son. “When I heard about the accident, I was certain that he would not survive considering how he used to travel at high speeds. It was obvious it would claim his life,” the senior Kadungure said. He revealed that Ginimbi was the second born in a family of four and that he was survived by two sisters. “Burial arrangements will be advised in due course. However, I am sure it will take a long time to come up with burial arrangements considering how popular the guy was. “We will wait for all his personal and business friends to come,” his father said. Genius’ eldest sister Juliet said she was at a loss for words. “I am still to come to terms with his death. He passed away at a time when we needed him most in the family. “We lost our mother in January and also a brother within a short space of time. We were in the process of organising a joint tombstone unveiling ceremony for our mother and brother, but now this,” Juliet said. When the Daily News visited the accident scene yesterday, the road leading to the area was chock-a-block with slow moving cars, as people rushed to the spot to have a glimpse of the place. Vehicles formed long queues from morning till evening — with Ginimbi’s followers taking photographs of the wreckage of the Rolls Royce. Thomas Masango, who witnessed the accident, told the Daily News that the scene of the accident was considered a black spot. “We heard the sound of a collision and rushed to the scene only to witness a horrific accident. We tried all we could to save the situation but to no avail. “We managed to douse the flames using water before the arrival of fire fighters. “We pulled Ginimbi out of the wreckage, but it was too late. The three passengers in the vehicle were all burnt. “A number of accidents have happened at the same spot and Ginimbi is the latest victim. “Most of the motorists will be speeding and some of them end up failing to negotiate the curve and lose control of their vehicles,” Masango said. Mourners are gathered in Chinamhora Village in Domboshava, the Kadungure family homestead. Meanwhile, Malawian online newspaper Nyasa Times has reported that fugitive Malawian, Limumba Karim, was allegedly among the people who perished in Ginimbi’s Rolls Royce. Karim was wanted by the Malawian government over his role in one of that country’s biggest ever scandals which involved over two billion kwacha. At the time of his death, the Malawian government was pushing for Karim’s extradition from South Africa to face justice in his homeland. Sponsored Links
