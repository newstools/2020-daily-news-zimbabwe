sibandat@dailynews.co.zw SOUTH Africa-based Afro-fusion singer William “Willionair” Magwiroto, pictured, who in March tested positive for Covid-19, has fully recovery and will be dropping a new track, Mamalolo this month. Willionair will be featuring Nigerian musician Fireboy DML in the song produced by Mutual Beats from Zimbabwe and Redemption beats from Ghana. In an interview with the Daily News, Willionair said: “I have fully recovered and I am glad to be back doing what I love most, which is music and my fans can brace themselves for this new hit with Fireboy DML.” He said it is good that musicians can still work together in collaborations despite being in different geographical locations because of the availability of Internet in most countries. He said would not allow the lockdown or other negative changes that have been caused by the pandemic to deter him from pursuing his musical dream. “My team and I will also be dropping the long awaited single Mebo very soon. While people have still to stay at home I am happy that the Internet has helped people access and enjoy new music from the comfort of their homes.” Willionair urged people from all walks of life to take this pandemic seriously and stay safe.
Willionair tested positive on March 27 before being admitted into hospital on April 6. He then tested negative on April 20.
