chayav@dailynews.co.zw AFRO-FUSION musician Philani “Phitso” Mhlanga will launch a new single Manyanya on SABC Livhu radio on Sunday. Mhlanga said the move is meant to market his music in the neighbouring country of South Africa. “I believe Zimbabwe is awash with talent but what is lacking is the exposure. If we manage to market our music beyond the country’s borders, nothing is going to stop us from making it as a country,” he said. “After launching the single in South Africa, I am going to launch it again on one of the radio stations in Zimbabwe.”
The song, which is heavy with political undertones, urges leaders to be responsible in society.
Mhlanga’s latest song follows the Munhu Munhu video which was released in February. “For one to get at the top in the music industry, one has to ceaselessly drop new music pieces one after the other. The market should always have something new and this helps,” he said.
Mhlanga carved his musical career as a gospel musician before switching to Afro-fusion. “I am really inspired by the works of legendary musicians such as the late Oliver Mtukudzi and Tongai Moyo among others. The music is original and people will continue to enjoy their music for years and that is exactly what I am striving to achieve with my music,” the Legacy Band frontman said. Mhlanga was ushered into the limelight in 2014, courtesy of his second studio album, Dream Again.
Born in Checheche, Chipinge in Manicaland Province, he first worked with Gospel Explosion Evangelistic Ministries, a musical group in Bulawayo. He later crossed the Limpopo to South Africa in search of greener pastures.
