ZAMBIA-BASED gospel musician Callista Gombera-Shumba has dropped a new music video titled Grace. The video was shot in Zambia by Co-Pilot Media House and touches on God’s grace in the singer’s life. “The song’s video was inspired by what God has done in my life. I have seen His grace,” the 27-year-old singer said. She is humbled by the response the song and video received in Zambia and Zimbabwe. “The song (both audio and video) has received a fair share of airplay here in Zambia. It was played on Zambia National Broadcasting Cooperation TV2, Camnet TV and on various social media pages among others.” Gombera-Shumba who is last born in a family of four, started singing commercially in 2017. “I started singing at the age of six in church where my siblings and parents would be the backing vocalists. “I joined the Praise and Worship at the age of 13 up to date,” the mother of two said.   “I got into the studio for the first time in 2017 where I recorded my first two singles Rumbidzo Mutirongo and Zvaringana.” Gombera-Shumba grew up in Melfort. “I attended Rusununguko High School before enrolling at Midlands State University for an Honours degree in Local Governance. Currently I am pursuing Masters in Spatial Planning at the University of Zambia,” she said. Some of her songs include Masuwo featuring Kuda Mkuli and Iye Ari Iye featuring Minister Stylez A among others. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); In the gospel music industry, Gombera-Shumba looks up to great musicians such as The Charambas, Ada Ehi Moses and Mercy Chinwo among others.
