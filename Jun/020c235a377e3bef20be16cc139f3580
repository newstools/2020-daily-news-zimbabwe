Jeffrey Muvundusi in BULAWAYO AFRO-POP musician Jeys Marabini was over the weekend left humbled after arts guru Cont Mhlanga paid a surprise visit at his Nkulumane home where he runs his recording studio. Mhlanga, the founder of the renowned Amakhosi Cultural Centre, is known for grooming several local artists some of whom are now based in the diaspora. Despite having retired from active arts and now based at his rural home in Lupane, he has not lost touch with the industry that made him an icon in the last three decades. With Marabini being one of Mhlanga’s protégés, the veteran arts administrator made a surprise follow up to see how the singer has been progressing in the cut-throat arts industry. “I am still humbled to have someone of such stature like Cont giving me a surprise visit. It was one of my great moments in life. You know some of us who passed through the hands of Cont; we regard him as the arts president, therefore he is special to us and the industry at large,” Marabini said. During the visit, Mhlanga managed to tour Marabini’s recording studio where many local artists have found a new home. Marabini’s studio has to date recorded a variety of music genres both from upcoming and seasoned. The studio has been used as a platform for rehearsal by some artists. What is different about this studio is that Marabani records young new artists free of charge. “Cont had to go through a lot of work which I am doing here and he gave advice which I really appreciate considering that this was coming from a godfather, someone who has seen it all in the industry. Above all, he was excited about what he saw here and advised me to labour on despite the economic challenges faced in the country,” Marabini said.
