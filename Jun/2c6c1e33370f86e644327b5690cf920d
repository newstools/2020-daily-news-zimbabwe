in BULAWAYO THE Heath Streak Cricket Academy is on cloud nine after they were granted permission to resume training by the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) during the coronavirus (Covid-19) lockdown. All sporting events were suspended in March when the novel virus began to spread across the world and in Zimbabwe. While the nationwide lockdown is still in place, the government has in recent weeks relaxed some of the measures with non-contact sport now being allowed to resume training provided they put in place stringent health protocols at their venues. The academy is encouraging their age-group cricketers to bring their own sanitisers, face masks and playing gear to minimise the spread of the virus. Zimbabwe international and captain Sean Williams is also resident at the academy and is helping the young cricketers learn their craft. The academy, is a non-profit making entity and has lately hailed the support it has continually received from their main sponsor, Old Mutual, and other associate partners during the Covid-19 crisis.
