THE government has increased the amount of money paid to millers providing subsidised roller meal by 52 percent, at a time when the commodity has disappeared from the supermarkets and is being sold on the black market at inflated prices. This comes as small-scale millers have appealed to the government to increase maize allocations and release outstanding payments to ensure consumers have adequate supplies of the subsidised roller meal. In a statement yesterday, Industry and Commerce minister Sekai Nzenza said the increase in the amount paid to millers would not affect the retail price of the subsidised roller meal. “The subsidy to millers has been adjusted from $73,90 per 10kg bag to $216,15.
“The government will continue to review these prices in consultation with stakeholders,” she added. This comes as prices of basic commodities have skyrocketed beyond the reach of many long-suffering Zimbabweans, whose salaries have been eroded by inflation.
