DREAMSTAR Zimbabwe, an annual talent search show is conducting virtual auditions which will end on June 27.
Dreamstar Zimbabwe head of marketing Panashe Nyakawa said as an organisation, they are happy with the response they got so far, considering that this year is a different one. “Every sector was affected by the coronavirus-induced national lockdown. Though the auditions were expected to commence on June 1, there was low activity for the past two weeks and people only responded on June 15 onwards. Yesterday we received 102 videos which is a positive development,” Nyakawa said. Over the years, the talent search show auditioned thousands of people as the organisation scouted for talent in universities, colleges and related communities. Now, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the organisation introduced virtual auditions where interested people are asked to record 30-90 seconds videos in landscape mode and then submit them online to Dreamstar Zimbabwe. “After that all is done, we will screen episodes where people will be able to view the performances across all Dreamstar Zimbabwe social media platforms,” Nyakawa said. This year, the overall winner will get US$4 000, second prize will be  US$1 500, third prize US$750, finalists US$250 and people’s choice is US$1 000.
