 TWO more people have been nabbed in connection with the alleged siphoning of $158 million from POSB Bank in a case which has sucked in the bank accounts clerk.
Hazel Makarau, 42, and Malvin Makarau, 39, appeared in court charged with fraud and were remanded out of custody on $5 000 bail each.
It is said on June 13, Hazel — who is an account holder with the bank — received $30 million in her account which was allegedly initiated by her accomplices.
It is the State’s case that she went on to transfer $201 000 into various mobile money accounts before going shopping together with Malvin.
Claims are that they went on to buy goods worth $20 102 and household goods among them a bed worth $28 575, and deep freezer worth $26 620 using the said money.
It is said the two were arrested on June 18 and groceries worth $1 575 were recovered.
The court heard the offence came to light on June 15, when POSB international bank manager conducted a reconciliation of the transactions made on June 13 on the general ledger and discovered the transactions with high values and irregular source.
She notified the bank authorities and reversed $156 690 000 from the syndicate’s five bank accounts.
Reports are that there are three other accounts which received $30 million each.
The alleged offence has since sucked in the bank clerk Mercy Meda, 34, together with police details Martin Mavhiya and John Nyika.
