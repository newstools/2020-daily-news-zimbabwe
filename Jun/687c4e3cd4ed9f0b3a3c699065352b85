MUTARE-based gospel musician Blessing Shumba has embarked on a re-branding exercise as he moves with the changing times. This exercise will see Shumba re-working some of his music videos as well as embarking on an aggressive marketing of his music mainly on the Internet. This year, the award-winning musician is not going to release new music. “We are working on new videos, pushing our works on social media platforms including YouTube, Spotify, Amazon, Twitter and online stores among others to promote our works in the country and beyond,” Shumba said. The musician, who is also into business, said the purpose of gospel music is to transform society. “The idea of preaching is to change society. As preachers, we strive to reach everyone in the communities. We have released a number of albums with different messages and this year we are not going to release one but to promote what we already have,” Shumba said. Shumba cut a niche in the music industry at a tender age, taking part in church choirs before joining forces with his family members in an accapella group called Vakushi Veshoko. His family members quit the music industry due to the harsh economic environment in the country, leaving Shumba behind. He forged ahead and formed Holy Psalms of Mutare and recorded the album Ishe Wazvose in 2008. The album comprise plug songs such as Kurwa Kwakanaka among others
