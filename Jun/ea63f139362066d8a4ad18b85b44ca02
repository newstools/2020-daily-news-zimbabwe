chayav@dailynews.co.zw SUNGURA kingpin Alick Macheso has joined a host of musicians who have taken their projects online as he will digitally celebrate his 52nd birthday tomorrow. This comes as government has suspended all arts and entertainment activities in order to curb the spread of the deadly coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic by discouraging gatherings. “Each year, Macheso celebrates his birthday with his fans. This year is going to be different as we are not going to meet them physically but as it is part of our tradition, we have decided to celebrate it online in line with Covid-19 regulations,” Macheso and Orchestra Mberikwazvo publicist Tich Makahamadze said. “We urge our fans in all parts of the country to catch us live online.”
Macheso was born on June 10 in 1968 and grew up in the farming community of Shamva. He started playing the bass guitar commercially at a tender age of 15 with the Vhuka Boys. Over the years, he perfected his artistic skills until he launched his solo career in 1997 when he controversially parted ways with Nicholas Zakaria and the Khiama Boys. As a solo musician, Macheso churned hit-after-hit since 1998 when he released his debut studio album Magariro.
In 2018, his loyal fans tried but in vain to push the University of Zimbabwe to award him an honorary doctorate degree for his contribution to the music industry.
