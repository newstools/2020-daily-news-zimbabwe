  GRAFT accused Health minister Obadiah Moyo yesterday appeared in court and was granted $50 000 bail, the Daily News On Sunday reports. The 66-year-old was arrested on Friday on graft charges linked to the US$60 million acquisition of coronavirus supplies.President Emmerson MnangagwaLast week, Harare businessman Delish Nguwaya — who is the local representative of the foreign company Drax International, which was allegedly awarded the deal corruptly — was also nabbed by authorities.
Moyo will be back in court on July 31.
As part of his bail conditions, he was ordered to report thrice a week to the police, surrender his passport and not to interfere with State witnesses.
Prosecutor Clemence Chimbare told the court yesterday that Moyo was in March last year approached by Papi Pharma LLC Zimbabwe representative Nguwaya, who expressed interest to supply medicines and medical sundries under a US$15 million loan facility.
Moyo is then alleged to have directed former permanent secretary in the ministry, Gerald Gwinji, to process the paperwork and award the tender to Papi Pharma LLC.
Gwinji was said to have written to Treasury requesting a due diligence exercise to be carried out on the company, before it could be awarded the contract.
But Moyo reportedly used his weight to block this process.
Gwinji went on to direct Natpharm general manager Nancy Flora Sifeku to proceed with the procurement process and the tender was awarded to Papi Pharma LLC in May last year, even though the due diligence was still pending.“On June 14 an adverse report was received from Foreign Affairs and International Trade secretary James Manzou indicating that the company and its director Klodian Allajbeu were linked to a terrorist group known as Gulen Movement,” court papers say.The court was also told that Moyo caused the country a potential prejudice of US$15 million.
It is further alleged that in August last year, Nguwaya visited the Health minister in the company of Illir Dedja, a legal representative of Drax Consult SAGL, who expressed interest in supplying drugs worth US$20 million to the country.
A due diligence exercise was ordered to be carried out on the company, and the President’s Office raised concerns over the firm’s capacity.
However, Moyo allegedly exerted pressure on his subordinates, including former Health ministry permanent secretary Agnes Mahomva, to award a tender to Drax.“On December 11, Natpharm and Drax entered into a contract and supplied medicine and surgical sundries worth US$2 733 980, of which US$2 million was paid by Treasury into Drax’s Hungary account.
Moyo’s conduct caused a potential prejudice of US$17 266 020,” the court heard.Moyo reportedly caused the country a potential prejudice of US$40 million after causing another contract to be entered between the government and Drax.
Treasury ordered the cancellation of the contract, but Drax supplied Covid-19 test kits valued at US$987 720.
In May, Moyo reportedly gave an instruction for Finance ministry permanent secretary George Guvamatanga to facilitate clearance of the test kits which were held at the airport, after being supplied under the cancelled Drax deal.
Moyo allegedly personally handed over an invoice worth US$987 720 to Guvamatanga in a bid to influence acceptance of test kits procured through the Drax contract.
The Health minister is said to have claimed that there were 15 000 test kits at the airport, before it was discovered that there were only 3 000.
A number of officials from the government medical supplies firm, NatPharm — among them Sifeku (67), operations manager Charles Mwaramba (78) and finance manager Rolland Mlalazi (55) — have also been arrested in connection with the US$60 million deal.
