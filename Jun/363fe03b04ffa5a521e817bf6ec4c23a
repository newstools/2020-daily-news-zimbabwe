THE security clampdown that has been restricted to Harare over the past few weeks was yesterday extended to the country’s second city, the Daily News reports.
The operation, which caught many people by surprise, saw thousands of workers and ordinary people being barred from entering Bulawayo’s central business district (CBD).
By midday, the CBD was deserted as security forces turned people away, causing chaos on all the roads leading into the city centre in the process. Rather surprisingly, even garage workers and people queuing at fuel stations were not spared by the uncompromising security forces.
Similarly, Zupco buses were also emptied before hundreds of their passengers were ordered to go back home on foot.
Commenting on yesterday’s operation, national police spokesperson Paul Nyathi said this was in keeping with the lockdown regulations.
“People should realise that the country is still under lockdown. Yes, there were some concerns (on the clampdown) that were raised, which were addressed by the Officer Commanding Bulawayo.
“There was a situation where a lot of people were getting into the CBD for no apparent reasons.
“Members of the public should be warned that only those exempted to work during the lockdown are allowed to get into the CBD,” Nyathi told the Daily News.
Zimbabwe is currently under a relaxed, but indefinite lockdown — which authorities hope helps to combat the spread of coronavirus in the country.
