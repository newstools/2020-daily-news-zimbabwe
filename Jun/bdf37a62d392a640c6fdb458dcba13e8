chayav@dailynews.co.zw VETERAN gospel musician Amos Mahendere is excited by the response to his yet to be released song Serendipity after he sampled it on a recent online concert. The song is expected to be officially released next week.
“I am still in shock. I just performed the song at an online concert before its actual release date but the response I am getting right now is amazing,” Mahendere said. The song is off his new album No Stress No Fear which comprises six tracks and meant for release later this year. “After the performance, I had no other option but to make an accompanying video to the song such that I can quickly cover for my intellectual rights. I feared the song was going to be stolen owing to its popularity on the market,” he said. To effectively promote the song, Mahendere is contemplating making another video for the song. “We are going to do another video where we will invite different dancers to join us; so it’s going to be more of a Serendipity dance competition,” he said. Since he performed the song online, Mahendere has been booked to perform in foreign countries thanks to the tune’s success. “So far, I have been booked in South Africa and the United Kingdom. Fans have fallen in love with the song; they want us to perform there. However, we are just praying that things will normalise soon in terms of the coronavirus pandemic in the world such that we can fulfil the lined-up concerts.” Songs making the forthcoming album include Serendipity, We Praise You, Shalom, Rudimbwa, Parwendo and Anotichengeta. “They are all danceable songs that require full energy,” he said.
Meanwhile, on Sunday the musician will be part of guests to speak on the online Music Talk Show where they will discuss issues affecting the music industry in general. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); Other guests include Victor Kunonga and Olinda Marowa among others.
