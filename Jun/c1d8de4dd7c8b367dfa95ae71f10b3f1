sibandat@dailynews.co.zw LOCAL professional dance instructor Panashe Munemo has launched virtual dance classes for children that will be taking place every Saturday at 1pm throughout the lockdown period. These are fun, energy-filled dance classes made up of easy-to-follow dance and fitness choreography broken down into kids friendly routines comprising games and themed activities for children aged three to 11 years old. In an interview with the Daily News Munemo said these sessions appeal to children who are active in sports and physical activities. “The classes are aimed at keeping children active while at home during these tough times under lockdown.” The classes will take place every Saturday via ZOOM and they will be held as long as people remain under lockdown. “The sessions may continue after the lockdown if interested schools, sponsors and parents/guardians of the children ask for the virtual classes to stay. “As a professional dancer, Zumba dance teacher, children’s dance instructor and a certified group fitness professional, I had to adapt to the working-from-home model of business to offer these essential services virtually.” Munemo said the dance classes are a positive development that offers healthy lifestyle.
He added that the current Covid-19 pandemic has put everything on a go-slow and some sources of income on a standstill and for one to actually make money they have to think hard and dig deep to keep the creativity alive. Covid-19 has also taken away the joy and feeling of face to face personal interaction with clients, students and participants. Organisations and individuals have to adapt to the unexpected change in their business models.”
