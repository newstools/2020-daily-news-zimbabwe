ZIMBABWE Defence Forces (ZDF) commander, General Philip Valerio Sibanda, says the level of corruption displayed by some of the country’s leaders is tantamount to selling out. Speaking in a rare interview posted by the ruling Zanu PF party on Twitter, the army commander — who took over from retired general Vice President Constantino Chiwenga after the November 2017 military intervention that ousted the late former president Robert Mugabe — said: “It’s unfortunate that after independence some of us went wayward and started corruptly amassing wealth, but during the war we were taught to share. It’s a value some of us maintain up to today.” The general made the statement before the burial of Stanley Nleya at the National Heroes Acre on Wednesday, his colleague in the Zimbabwe People’s Revolutionary Army (Zipra) led by the late Joshua Nkomo during Zimbabwe’s war of independence. When tanks rolled on to the streets of Harare in November 2017, one of the reasons behind the putsch was because Mugabe had allegedly surrounded himself with “criminal elements” accused of corruption. Today, Zimbabwe is ranked 158 out of 180 countries on Transparency International’s corruption index as President Emmerson Mnangagwa seems to be losing the fight against corruption. Speaking at the National Heroes’ Acre in Harare during Nleya’s burial, Mnangagwa pleaded with people in positions of authority to be honest and exemplary in putting public interest ahead of selfishness. “The war against our economic growth is ongoing but the enemies will never win if we remain united,” he said.
The latest corruption scandal in Zimbabwe is on a US$60m drugs deal tender for Covid-19 medical supplies. Harare businessman Delish Nguwaya is in remand prison, while health minister Obadiah Moyo is out on a $50 000 bail over the same matter. SOURCE: — Timeslive
