TALENTED singer Tocky Vibes says he strives to balance the interests of his diverse listenership as amplified on his latest album Dhongi Newaya. The title of the 20-track album, according to the singer, means precision, hence the message contained is suited to situations people face on a daily basis. He says the album brings hope to the nation at a time when the country is plagued by Covid-19 with messages for people in different circumstances, touching on various societal issues among them marriage and barrenness. “People need something they can identify with, someone who can speak on their behalf and this is what Dhongi Newaya is all about. “Everyone has a battle they are fighting in their lives and they need hope and this where the music comes in,” he said. The album also shows his versatility in working with singers from other genres, having worked with different producers among them TMan, Oskid and Lazzie T. Tocky Vibes engaged gospel musician Mathias Mhere, rapper Ti Gonzi and Amos Mahendere in one of the tracks titled Ndisunungure. He also worked with Progress Chipfumo on another song titled Mukana. “The idea is to cater for the taste of a diverse following hence the idea of having singers from other genres. “I’m happy the idea has been embraced judging from the response the songs are getting. We had to tell God what we desire and this is the idea behind the song Ndisunungure,” he said. He did not forget his dancehall roots on the album with a track Ghetto. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); The album was released online following disruptions owing to the scourge of Covid-19 which barred entertainment gatherings. “The album had to be released. It could not be kept for long as it had to serve a purpose. “We are at a time when the country is faced with coronavirus and people are depressed and music is the vehicle through which people find comfort,” he said.
