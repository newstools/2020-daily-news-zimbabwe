Sowell Chikwari LIFESTYLE WRITER chikwaris@dailynews.co.zw  UPCOMING sungura musician Davitah Chimombe, pictured, has sensationally claimed that he is the late musical legend James Chimombe’s son. The South African-based singer, who purportedly fronts his own band, The Ocean City Band, said he will officially engage the Chimombe family on the matter.  Speaking from his South African base, Davitah said: “Indeed the late James Chimombe is my father. This matter is being looked into at family level. “Nevertheless I started my own musical career a few years ago and I expect to launch a new album here next month titled Chakuma. “I am overwhelmed by the support I continue to receive from fellow Zimbabwean musicians, family and friends and I hope my latest project will cement my position in the showbiz industry.” Chimombe’s daughter, singer Tendai could neither ascertain nor dispute Davitah’s claim. “Though this is my first time hearing about that issue, I am not the right person to comment about that but I would advise him to follow the right channels and engage the family properly such that the matter can be looked into at family level but on my part I have no problems whatsoever with him or any other family members,” said Tendai. Born on March 15, 1981, Davitah is set to unveil his eight-track debut album in South Africa, officially signalling his entry into Zimbabwe’s cutthroat music industry. He has previously shared the stage with some notable artistes in the country including Allan Chimbetu, Dino Mudondo and Willom Tight where he belted the late Huchi Band’s timeless hits including Jemedza, Kudakwashe, Mavanga and others. James Chimombe was a talented vocalist and guitarist for the Huchi Band. He was born in 1951 and passed on in 1990 having rose to stardom in the early 1980s with hits such as Siya Waoneka, Jikinya, Chigwaya, George Mudiwa, Jemedza and Kudakwashe, among others
