in BULAWAYO BULAWAYO-BASED health practitioner Kenneth James Du Plooy has successfully launched his second motivational book titled Electrifying Your Passion. Kenneth Du Plooy is an author and an emergency healthcare practitioner who has for over 17 years been actively involved with serving the community in which he is based. Having previously published his maiden book, Smashing Your Limitations, he bounces back with another smash carrying incisive content aimed at equipping the reader with the essential skills needed to get through life. “Electrifying Your Passion is a motivational book journaling a little on my life and the challenges that I overcame as I struggled to stay afloat in society. “The book takes the reader on a fascinating journey through self-discipline and self-discovery as we constantly face fear and procrastination,” he said. Having lived in poverty during his early stages Kenneth managed to create a better life for himself. In the book, he has a chapter dedicated on knowing how to structure your life so as you retire into a more fulfilled person. He says many people fail to make it through to good retirement because they have not quite understood their age boundaries. “We all have a responsibility and we’re all accountable for what happens to us in life. Through our own actions, we have to put in the work. You need to prepare yourself for any challenges that come your way so that you’re ready to barge your way through without much panic,” he said. Kenneth’s books are on Amazon and he has hard copies of his books available for purchase. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });
