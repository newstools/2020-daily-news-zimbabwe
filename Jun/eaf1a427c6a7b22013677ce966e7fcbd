Ziyambi told Parliament last week that Zacc and NPA must adequately do their job before arresting people in order to avoid the catch and release scenario.  “The arm that arrests people is not the one that determines what happens in the court.
“Their job is to present the evidence that they have so that the court can determine.
“However, what we have tried to do now is; we are in the process of saying, the police, Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission and the prosecution must sit down together and agree that this docket is ready for prosecution before they go on to arrest.  “We are trying to encourage them to remove this silo mentality and work together, the investigators and those lawyers who are responsible for prosecution so that they satisfy each other that they have a case that they can prosecute and win.  “So, this is the new approach that we are encouraging and we hope that going forward, there is going to be an improvement in that regard.  “Once they do that, then our focus will now shift to say; why are we getting more acquittals when these are satisfied that the cases are like this,” Ziyambi said.  When he assumed power after then President Robert Mugabe was forced to resign in November 2017, President Emmerson Mnangagwa raised the hopes of many when he promised to uproot corruption, but it seems people now doubt his sincerity on fighting graft.  The anti-corruption drive seems to be losing steam, with some bigwigs who had been accused of wrongdoing being acquitted or removed from remand.
