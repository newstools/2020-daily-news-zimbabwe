Vasco Chaya LIFESTYLE WRITER chayav@dailynews.co.zw PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa has inspired humourists in the country who are cashing in on his stunts when he addresses the public, the Daily News reports. This comes after Doc Vikela launched the Vakuru episodes which satirise Mnangagwa and have become an instant hit with comedy lovers on social media. Owing to the series’ popularity on social media, Vikela told the Daily News yesterday the Vakuru episodes will run till 2030. “The comedy series is here to stay. It will run until 2030 when the president (Mnangagwa) resigns, saka 2030 tenge tichipo,” he said. Donning the head of State’s trademark scarf, Vikela whose real name is Victor Mpofu routinely imitates Mnangagwa in his skits. “The series are meant to entertain and to make our president more conscious whenever he makes a speech. “Over the years, I used to imitate popular figures in the country including musicians Suluman Chimbetu, Alick Macheso and television personality Mai Chisamba among others but Mnangagwa has inspired me the most. “I used to mimic the late former president Robert Mugabe but I was cautious. He had a record of beating up people,” he said. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); Mnangagwa has become the target of satirists after his speeches attracted a lot of attention in the country, mainly for the wrong reasons. Among them is the famous jibe murivo nemapotato he made while addressing residents in Kuwadzana. He encouraged them to eat vegetables and potatoes after they complained of high meat prices. Vikela, now working alongside Boss Kedha who plays the role of a security guard to the president, was also inspired by the works of the popular Ugandan comedian Teacher Mpamire who is famous for mimicking that county’s  President Yoweri Museveni. “Teacher Mpamire has inspired a new wave of satire. I have watched Teacher Mpamire’s skits a lot and I really enjoy them,” Vikela said.
