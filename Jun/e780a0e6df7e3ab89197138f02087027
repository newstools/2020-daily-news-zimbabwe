chayav@dailynews.co.zw GOSPEL singer Mambo Dhuterere, pictured, is going ahead with plans to launch a new studio album in August despite the coronavirus (Covid-19)-induced national lockdown, which has forced many local musicians to withhold their new music. Popular for his Dare Guru album released last year, Mambo Dhuterere said he is going ahead with the release as his business is to preach the gospel to all corners of the world. “I am not into music for money but to preach the word.
“I have a message to deliver to the people during this period, hence I cannot wait for the lockdown to be lifted.
“Gospel musicians are called to offer hope to the troubled and hopeless,” Mambo Dhuterere said. Real name Darlington Mutseta, Mambo Dhuterere is banking on online royalties.
“After releasing the album, I can still make money through online royalties. We do not rely on live concerts anymore,” said the 28-year-old musician. Most musicians have put their new music on hold, waiting for the government to lift the coronavirus-induced national lockdown hoping to capitalise on the official launch events. Mambo Dhuterere, who fellowships at St John Apostolic Church of the Whole World, ventured into the music industry in 2014. To date, he has three albums: Dhuterere, Tsamba and Dare Guru.
After releasing Dare Guru, Mambo Dhuterere went on to collaborate with a number of musicians including Mathias Mhere and Seh Calaz, among others. His collaboration with Seh Calaz titled Reurura dominated local radio charts for weeks.
Born and bred in Guruve, Mambo Dhuterere hogged the limelight after attacking self-styled preachers in his songs including Chiuya Ishe and Dare Guru among others. He labelled them (preachers motivated by the love of money) as “hustlers” and “wolves in sheep skins.”
Mambo Dhuterere is of the opinion that God’s power is for free and anyone who sells it is a thief.
