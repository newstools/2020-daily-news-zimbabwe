 SPORTS EDITORmatongoreren@dailynews.co.zwAS ZIMBABWE football authorities dither on aligning the season to the international calendar, it is a different scenario on the continent where previously odd leagues are now moving with the times.Local football has always been played between March and December but the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak has prevented the 2020 season from kicking off as normal.This has given oxygen to the debate for Zimbabwe football to adopt the international calendar, which runs from August to May.Over the years, this route has been met with stiff resistance as the naysayers always bring up the failed attempt to realign the season in 1999.The Premier Soccer League (PSL) tried to go this route that year but the season faced a lot of challenges as most matches were abandoned or postponed due to waterlogged pitches during the rainy season.However, 20 years later, local football finds itself at a crossroads regarding this matter, especially at such a crucial time when valuable time has been lost due to the spread of the novel virus.The Confederation of African Football (Caf) has been pushing for all its member associations to align to the August-May calendar.Most of the leagues on the continent have complied but Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique have resisted the move in the Cosafa region.But Zimbabwe will soon find itself the odd one out after the Football Association of Malawi (Fam) resolved to permanently change the season to August-May.Fam secretary-general Alfred Gunda made the announcement which was greeted as good news by football stakeholders and analysts.“I feel the calendar will enable a smooth transfer of players among clubs in the country and clubs outside the country as well,” football analyst George Chiusiwa told the Nyasa Times.“Fam could not do otherwise because of the Covid-19 pandemic that affected the country. It is good that Fam engaged different stakeholders to arrive at the decision.“This is not the first time for the country to have that kind of football calendar. We had a similar calendar around 2003.”In Mozambique, football authorities are also pondering a change as well after the start of the 2020 season was delayed by Covid-19.The Mozambique top-flight league, which is popularly known as MocamBola, was due to start on April 4 but is currently suspended because of the coronavirus-induced lockdown.Mozambique Football Federation (MFF) and MocamBola officials are due to meet this month to review the situation, prompting national team coach Luis Goncalves to give the move the thumbs up.“I can only see positive aspects with the change of season. It will allow players who play outside the country and inside to be competing at the same time and on the same level in competitive terms,” Goncalves told the Mozambican media last week.While the other remaining nations in the region are finally synchronising with the rest of the continent, Zimbabwe will be left all alone.The only body which has the power to change the local football calendar is the Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) Annual General Assembly (AGM).At last year’s indaba, Zifa councillors refused to change the calendar, insisting that more consultations needed to be done.With the Zifa AGM indefinitely suspended due to coronavirus, it is unclear when local football can finally realign the season.In recent years, Zimbabwe’s failure to align the season with the rest of the world has seen a lot of fixture clashes between the league and the international assignments.
