in BULAWAYO NHIMBE Trust has come to the rescue of women in theatre by offering them grants to help advance their work and access technology in the face of coronavirus (Covid-19) restrictions. According to Nhimbe Trust director Josh Nyapimbi, each of the six women — Lady Tshawe, Delma Chiwereva, Agnes Moyo, Nomathamsanqa Mkwananzi, Gertrude Munhamo and Laura Ngwenya — received a grant of $2 500. One of the beneficiaries Lady Tshawe said: “As a member of the programme under Nhimbe Trust it was such an honour and pleasure to receive a digital resilience grant that enabled me as an artist, among other female artists, to sustain myself during this period when we are uncertain when things will go back to normal, or when the lockdown will be lifted.” Another beneficiary, Moyo had this to say: “It’s very, very exhilarating. I am currently working on things I need to do, to post online. So I have been working with other artists to create online projects, videos and interviews.” Nhimbe Trust’s Women in Theatre and Television programme (WiTT) has for several years produced excellent musical plays including the thrilling theatre productions Tellers – The musical in 2016-2017 and Blood Tongue – The Musical 2017-2018 and seen the advancement of women to wider acclaim and award-winning status.
Nhimbe Trust’s main partner in the dynamic programme is Africalia, Belgium, whose motto is “Creativity is Life”.
