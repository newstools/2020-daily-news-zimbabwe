in BULAWAYO VETERAN disco musician Khulekani Bethule, aka Khuxxman, has posted a single track featuring multi-award-winning dance group Iyasa. The track, titled Jelemana, is now available online. The new song comes less than two months after Khuxxman’s sabbatical when he released an eight-track album titled Makhushukhushu. “The new track is a purely Zimbabwean sound and very different from what I usually release. It’s difficult to specify on the type of beat we used on the song but generally it’s a fusion of traditional and rhumba sounds driven by live guitars. “The song is about Jelimana, a drunkard, hooligan and thief but is my brother or sister, so it’s a complaint that my mother gave birth to a wayward character,” Khuxxman told the Daily News last week. On why he chose Iyasa for the collaboration, the Vumelani Sangoma hit-maker said: “They are one of the top arts groups in the country so it’s good for the growth of my brand and fusing our different styles is something I have always wanted to experiment on.” Asked why he posted a single soon after he had just released his new album, the disco sensation said: “These are totally different projects with probably a different audience so, in other words, the projects will complement each other.” He however, said he was happy with the way his album has been received online in the absence of live shows. “We have been on lockdown since I released the album and it’s hard to evaluate its impact. At the moment, I cannot sell CDs or do live shows to measure its success or failure though quite a lot of people have bought the album via online platforms such as WhatsApp and a number of CDs have been bought. The album is also enjoying fair airplay on local radio stations,” he said. While, Khuxxman has six disco albums, he also has three Afro-pop albums which include Ma Africa bambanani, Ngizohamba and Vumelani Sangoma as well as several singles.
