YOUTHFUL preacher Sheltons has challenged youths to move out of their cocoons and utilise the Internet during this lockdown period as a way of effectively curbing idleness and unproductivity during the indefinite closing of schools. With uncertainty still hanging over the opening of schools due to the Covid-19 outbreak, school-going children have been forced to stay home, limiting their time to education. However Sheltons, who is winning hearts with his online campaign against teenage pregnancies, illegal abortions and child marriages said he was now concerned about the uncertainty posed by the lockdown on children. “The Internet provides a platform to read and research school work and other various educational materials. “Parents and guardians should take the lead because naturally children like playing, so they should make sure their kids are not always on social media or watching movies,” the 26-year-old Sheltons whose real name is Shelton Sibanda said during his online campaigns. He said it was also important for the children to read as part of increasing their depth in knowledge on a variety of issues. Sheltons, who is the founder of Spirit Revival and Counter Church said school-going children should be prioritised as they are the future leaders. “The youth are the future and it should be noted that there is a lot of untapped potential that needs to be cultivated. With guidance they can achieve a lot by productively utilising the vast technology that is at their disposal. They stand to find out that there is no limit to what they can do with their lives,” he said. He further noted that there are many careers that can be built from various Internet applications accessible through technology such as graphic designing and photography among others. “There is a whole world of possibilities to be unlocked through these platforms for different passions and talents,” he said.
