STANBIC Bank (Stanbic) has completed the distribution of US$200 000 worth of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) to six major health institutions throughout the country over the last week. The leading financial services institution distributed five ventilators, 32 500, suits, masks, face shields and goggles, 2 400 PCR tests, 3 000 sanitizers for frontline workers to St Annes and Wilkins Hospitals in Harare, Gweru Provincial Hospital, Thorngrove Hospital in Bulawayo, Masvingo General Hospital and Mutare Infectious Hospital. Stanbic is also in the process of drilling boreholes in Cowdray Park, Bulawayo and Glen Norah C in Harare. Nellie Tiyago, Stanbic’s non-executive director, said the institution is committed to play a pivotal role in the fight against Covid 19 and recognises the importance of healthcare workers in this battle. Tiyago said the bank is all too aware that the frontline workers cannot function without PPEs and that the risk involved when discharging their duties is immense. “There are many frontline workers and we appreciate their efforts. Stanbic Bank is here to support the medical front liners who can in no way escape or avoid this war as they are the backbone of the survival of our people even when we are not in times of crisis,” she said. In Gweru, Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution in the Midlands, Senator Larry Mavhima received the goods on behalf of Gweru Hospital while the Mayors of Bulawayo and Mutare Solomon Mguni and Blessing Tandi respectively received the equipment for the health institutions in their jurisdiction. Stanbic’s contribution has extended to well beyond the purchase of PPEs and other equipment through the provision of US$2.8 million credit and allocation of foreign currency to its clients in the medical industry to acquire the needed health care items to help fight this pandemic.
