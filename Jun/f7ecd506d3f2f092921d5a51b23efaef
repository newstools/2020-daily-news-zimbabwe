Jeffrey Muvundusi in BULAWAYO BULAWAYO-based dancehall artiste Tawanda Tirivanhu aka DJ Tawaz has ventured into the trending South African amapiano beat with the release of a new single. Titled Amapiano mapara jazz chakalaka, the song features his United Kingdom-based uncle who is also a seasoned club wheel spinner DJ Welly Tee and a South African group called Mapara Jazz. Tawaz who is a resident club DJ at Private Lounge Bulawayo said the idea to switch beats came after he was influenced by Welly Tee. “My uncle suggested we could do something different from the usual dancehall. So he spoke to his friends from South Africa; Nhlanhla Peete, Lenny the Big boss and Man Malaya so they could produce an amapiano track with a touch of Zimbabwean flavour,” Tawaz said. The DJ who has lately been holed up at his Sizinda home due to the outbreak of Covid-19 said given enough airplay the song would be a sure hit. “I am very confident the song will do well in the market judging by the response it has been getting — few days since release. The other plus is when different minds come together, chances are high that you bring out something powerful,” he said. The track is already available online. Tawaz has 10 songs to his name, with two of them featuring Bulawayo-based reggae musician Centre Party of Wisdom Records. “This year my aim is to work with other artistes both locally and internationally as I move to take my music career seriously.” googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });
