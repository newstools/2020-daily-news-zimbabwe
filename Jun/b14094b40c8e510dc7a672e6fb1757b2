Km3 grew up in Bulawayo before moving to Europe where he is currently studying Law at the University of Dundee in Scotland. He said his dream is to one day become a practicing lawyer although his passion and gift is music.
“Like most students, I find it hard balancing both studying law which is a very demanding course and music. “With the current situation in the world including the Covid-19 pandemic and the riots in America I have been feeling very inspired to write more music that I hope will uplift people in these sad times and give them something to cheer about as well as put Zimbabwe on the map with my music.”
