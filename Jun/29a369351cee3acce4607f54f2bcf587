The inaugural Bulawayo Day and Bulawayo Arts Festival was scheduled for June 1 to 6 but because of the coronavirus (Covid-19) it has been postponed to June 2021. Instead, organisers have decided to bring it live online.  BCC public relations officer Nesisa Mpofu said they will, however, have three special virtual/ online pop-up events from June 3 to today (June 5) on the Byo Arts Festival, City of Bulawayo, BAF, Sound Kalcha, Bluez Café and CnC Productions Facebook pages.  Mpofu said the celebration of Bulawayo Day and the hosting of the Bulawayo Arts Festival was aimed at showcasing the heritage and rich history of the cosmopolitan city to the world.  The local authority last year declared June 1 as Bulawayo Day. The day was supposed to be marked by arts and cultural activities this year.
