THE worldwide coronavirus (Covid-19) lockdown has rekindled former band leader of Hohodza, Portia Gwanzura’s love and passion for music. Gwanzura left Zimbabwe in early 2002 having released more than 10 music albums and is now based in the UK in Greater Manchester where she has been running several businesses. The singer said she is in touch with most Zimbabweans musicians there. “Most band members who left other big groups when they toured the UK are all around here and we’re always in touch.” Gwanzura said most of her band members live around her. “We’re still one big happy family. My music is still the same although I did one English cover by Don Williams for Charity at the start of the pandemic. She added that several of her band members have their own recording studios including her son Robgee. “But the one I use most is owned by Enock Kamhiriri who is an original member of my band. Because I’ve only just started doing the music again I am still to sort out publishing. But I have quite a number of videos on YouTube.” And she is still in touch with guitarist Progress Chipfumo who he worked with at Hohodza while in Zimbabwe. The singer urged her fans to go and subscribe to her YouTube channel for all latest updates: Portia Gwanzura & Hohodza Band and on Facebook…..follow me on : Portia Gwanzura & Hohodza Band fanclub page. … googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });
