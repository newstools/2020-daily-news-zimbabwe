in BULAWAYO GERALDINE Roche Drama (GRD) an arts-focused organisation which specialises in drama and film production has launched an online film festival which will see several of its productions being showcased. Having suspended indefinitely its regional drama competition finals due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the organisation decided to launch its new baby known as the Geraldine Roche Film Festival. The festival will be showcased on the organisation’s official Facebook page once every Friday with a different film screened. Project coordinator Khaliphile Sibanda told the Daily News that the festival kicked off last week and they were looking forward to a positive response from film lovers. “Our drama competition finals are on hold for now and we have decided to take some of our activities online such as the film festival. It just started…we will live stream all the films with each being showcased every Friday. We will be live streaming on our Facebook page and this will happen for the next 16 weeks,” Sibanda said adding that each film was 24 minutes long. She further noted that the films in question were all done last year as part of their film programme where they unearth local talent and empower the young and talented. She said the films which premiered on ZBC-TV last year were well produced.
Some of the films showcasing include Zoey a girl called life, Short Dynamites, Home Affairs, Not Yet Time, Missed Period Cover Up, Unfortunate Victims and Love and Cameras among a host of others. GRD covers three provinces which include Bulawayo, Matabeleland North and Matabeleland South where it uses both drama and film production to deliver messages and education around various subjects of social advocacy.
