MDC ALLIANCE members Joanna Mamombe, Cecilia Chimbiri and Netsai Marova have been ordered by the courts to surrender their passports after the State alleged that they are planning to flee the country.  The trio is facing allegations of violating lockdown regulations by participating in a demonstration in Harare’s Warren Park suburb three weeks ago.
Through their lawyer Jeremiah Bamu, the three had challenged the State’s application to vary their bail conditions and to surrender passports saying the State had used a wrong section of the law in the application.
They also argued that with the global restrictions owing to the current coronavirus (Covid-19) scourge, it is not possible for anyone to travel. Harare magistrate Vongai Muchuchuti-Guuriro concurred with the defence that the State had cited a wrong section and also on difficulties in travelling.
But the court ruled that in the interest of justice, the trio have to surrender their passports and that the defence had not indicated any prejudice the trio would suffer by surrendering the passports.
The magistrate also said the trio did not challenge the authenticity of the information by the investigating officer that they had received information that resources had been mobilised for the trio to flee.
On Monday, investigating officer Hardwork Maziti told the court that resources had been mobilised for Mamombe, Chimbiri and Marova, and there were high chances that they would flee.
They will be back in court for routine remand on August 13.
