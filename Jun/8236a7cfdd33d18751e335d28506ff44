AUTHOR Samukeliso Ndlovu’s new debut book Hidden Tears of an African Woman tackles the predicaments faced by the girl-child. The book, edited and published by Billionaire publishers run by young Marshal Chiza revolves around issues surrounding the girl-child from her protection to transitioning into womanhood. “The book touches on issues like intra-familial rape which is hardly talked about openly, the issues of staying in toxic relationships because of poverty and dependency. It looks at cultural lessons taught to the girl-child that includes advising her not to give up on her marriage as it disgraces her family and staying in a violent marriage for the benefit of her children,” Ndlovu told Daily News. She was motivated to write the book because of unfair treatment and stigma against women and the girl-child. “I was inspired by the unfair treatment and stigma that is experienced by women when it comes to the issues of rape. “Many times in marriages women have to forego opportunities career-wise to be carers in the home and their potential is not realised. This leads to stress and depression.”
Ndlovu said she was inspired by Joyce Meyer, Sarah Jakes Roberts and Joel Osteen. She, however, said she had a few words of advice to the girl child. “My advice goes to the girl-child, to always take her dreams seriously and fight to be independent.
“I also want to encourage anyone who has had any setback in life that it is never too late to make a decision to turn things around and work towards one’s dream and passion.”
