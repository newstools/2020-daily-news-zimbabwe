HARARE – The Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) intends to register all recreational facilities for accountability purposes as well as increasing its revenue collection through subscriptions, the Daily News has learnt. Developing an up to date data base of recreational facilities ensures that the acceptable standards are kept and that the owners do not short change clients by making them use sub-standard venues. Ultimately the move ensures that the country is up to date with the current standards as dictated by the international federations. In a statement, SRC director-general Prince Mupazviriho called on the said owners to register with the association. “The SRC wishes to advise that in terms of the SRC Act…all recreational facilities must be registered with the SRC,” Mupazviriho said. “In this regard the SRC is calling upon all owners of recreational facilities such as fitness centres, play grounds, halls, play fields and pavilions among other centres to contact SRC for regularisation, assistance and guidance on the operations with regard to the COvid-19 pandemic.” Meanwhile, SRC is yet to roll out Covid-19 assistance to a selected group of most vulnerable athletes and officials. However, many have raised skepticism at the selection criteria that the SRC will come up with to hand over the donations or financial assistance arguing that they should guard against fly-by-night athletes and officials taking advantage of the situation. The real beneficiaries, critics have argued that they may end up not getting anything hence the calls for a clear cut and watertight criteria.
