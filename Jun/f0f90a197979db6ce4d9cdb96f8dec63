MDC-T acting president Thokozani Khupe yesterday threatened to wield the axe on more MPs and councillors who have continued to defy her leadership by flirting with the Nelson Chamisa-led MDC Alliance, the Daily News reports.
This comes as Khupe last month recalled four legislators, Chalton Hwende (Kuwadzana East), Prosper Mutseyami (Dangamvura Chikanga), Thabitha Khumalo (proportional representation MP) and Senator Lillian Timveos on allegations that they no longer represented the MDC-T interests in the august House.
But with reports that some MPs were still attending the MDC Alliance caucus meetings, MDC-T national chairperson Morgen Komichi told a media conference at the party’s Morgan Richard Tsvangirai House headquarters yesterday that they were running out of patience.
“Of course there is a saying that puppies do not see light on the same day, but there comes when you conclude that this is now blindness; that these puppies will never get their sight because it has been long.
“It has been exactly 80 days since the Supreme Court ruling and we have been patient with the MPs, but we cannot be patient forever. The Supreme Court ruling thrust Khupe as the acting leader of the MDC-T after annulling Chamisa’s rise in 2018 on account of failure to abide by the constitution upon the death of party founding president Morgan Tsvangirai in February 2018.
The MDC Alliance has, however, approached the High Court seeking an order stopping Parliament from expelling more legislators on the orders of its opposition rivals.
The four MPs are seeking an order that nullifies their expulsion from the august House, arguing that Speaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda acted unlawfully in accepting an instruction from a political party they did not belong to when they were voted as MPs in the 2018 elections.
But Komichi insisted yesterday that their group was the legitimate MDC with power over the party’s headquarters, MPs and councillors while Chamisa and his allies are a rebel faction.
