in BULAWAYO BULAWAYO businesswoman Paula Sarah, pictured, has ventured into gospel music, beginning a new journey into her music career. The Mberengwa-born 31-year-old says she was inspired by church leader Blessing Chiza, a development that saw her coming up with her debut album titled Call on the name of the Lord. Some of the plug tracks on the album include Every knee shall bow, Tinazvo and the title track Call on the name of the Lord featuring Audrey Chenai and Tinashe Soft of the Family Voices. The talented vocalist said she is also inspired by one of the fast rising Bulawayo gospel sensations, Mai Mwamuka.
“Currently, all my plans were thrown into disarray by the Covid-19 pandemic, but I am working on videos which will be released anytime soon. “As from next week I will be doing my first ever Facebook live streaming in collaboration with Chenai and House of Extreme Praise. We will be worshipping and praising.”
