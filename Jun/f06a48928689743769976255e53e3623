sibandat@dailynews.co.zw AFTER a hard hit from the effects of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the Learning Factory in Harare is currently developing content to commence their artistic classes virtually later this month. This move comes after the on-going lockdown had greatly affected their physical operations to an extent where they had to close down the art classes. In an interview with the Daily News, the Learning Factory founder Adi Mavengere said: “The lockdown has really affected things in a huge way and we had to put the Saturday classes on hold because of the lockdown. Mavengere said despite this hurdle, they have however, been focusing on developing online content for their students so that they have in-person and online options. He added that of late they have also been engaging investors about their initiative and hopefully before the end of June, they will have an exciting update for art lovers in that regard. “However, as soon as the lockdown ends and life gets back to normal, we will be proceeding with the coding, robotics and drone-building and racing physical classes too,” said Mavengere. He said so far, people are responding positively to their new stance of going virtual. Mavengere said eLearning is topical at the moment and so they might just be lucky and also secure a good deal in this regard. “The pandemic has really affected our programmes but it has also resulted in a potential investment so it’s a mixed bag of fortunes,” he said.
