chayav@dailynews.co.zw YESTERYEAR musician, Patrick Mukwamba of the Wapenga Nayo Bonus fame said he was overwhelmed when he received groceries from youthful singer King98 that he sold part of it. He had received groceries worth $10 000 on top of US$100 cash.
“Words cannot express enough what I felt after the surprise gift. The grocery was too much for me that I ended up selling part of it for US$60,” Mukwamba said. “I was so glad and I wish many of our youngsters could emulate what this young man has done.” In 2017, Mukwamba tried to launch a comeback to the music industry with a track called Hupenyu Hwangu. However, the song failed to revive his waning fortunes in the showbiz. It received a lukewarm response from the market. King98, who has some collaborations with the continent’s A-class of musicians including Nigeria’s Davido and South African hip-hop star Nasty C among others, said the donation was meant to cushion his fellow musicians against the effects of Covid-19 lockdown. “That was part of my charity work in the country. I have realised that local musicians are at a disadvantage, especially during this on-going lockdown, as they are grounded. They are not staging some concerts. In South Africa, music industry is a bit different, musicians there can realise profits by selling their music online. Here in Zimbabwe it’s a challenge owing to high levels of piracy in the music industry,” King98 said. The groceries received by Mukwamba could have lasted him up to December.
Recently, chanter Gift “Shiga Shiga” Katulika, drummer Sam Mataure and musician Progress Chipfumo benefited from the King98 charity initiative.
