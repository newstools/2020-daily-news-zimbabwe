Victoria Falls is the hottest tourist destination in southern Africa, and we’re not just talking about the weather. It’s an all-in-one destination that ticks all the boxes for every type of traveller, from adrenalin junkies to those who like to holiday in the slow lane. What’s not to love about Victoria Falls? You’re spoilt for choice for accommodation and there are so many activities on offer, it’s hard to fit in everything and still find time to enjoy long, lazy lunches overlooking the thundering waterfall.   To get an idea of the sheer scale and beauty of Victoria Falls, book an exhilarating Flight of the Angels helicopter flip for a bird’s-eye view of the spectacular national park.    Victoria Falls is the largest curtain of falling water in the world and largest waterfall based on its combined width and height. It’s also one of the 7 Natural Wonders of the World. The thundering waterfall is fed by the Zambezi River which starts in Zambia and winds its way through Angola, skirts around Namibia and Botswana, then along the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe to Mozambique where it empties out into the Indian Ocean. By the time it reaches Victoria Falls, the river is almost 2 kilometres wide. The deceptively placid waters suddenly explode into a powerful force as it tumbles over a sheer basalt cliff into the deep Batoka Gorge. Fueled by the powerful energy of the plunge and bottlenecked into a narrow channel, the Zambezi River becomes a raging torrent of surging water.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });  Perfect for the best white water rafting experience in the world!   Nowhere else in Africa will you have as much excitement and feel more invigorated after you’ve braved the best that Victoria Falls has to offer. You can rest assured you’ll have nothing more than an unforgettable experience because your safety is top priority.   Bungee jump off the Victoria Falls Bridge and drop an exhilarating 111 metres into the gorge below. Hurtle 425 metres above the Batoka Gorge on a zipline at a speed of over 100 klicks. Take a dip in Devil’s Pool on the edge of the Falls where only a slippery rock stands between you and a 38-storey drop to the gorge below. And plunge through white water rapids with names like Terminator and Oblivion on a rafting day you’ll never forget.    Travellers tend to forget that Victoria Falls is one of the best Big 5 safari destinations in southern Africa. You’ve got Stanley & Livingstone Game Reserve, the charming Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park and Victoria Falls Private Game Reserve a short 10-minute drive from town. Then you have Hwange National Park and Chobe National Park relatively close by for a day tour.

Victoria Falls is rich in cultural history, dating back 3 million years to the Early Stone Age. However, it was the Makolo tribe that introduced the secret of the giant waterfall to the world in 1855 when they took David Livingstone down the Zambezi River in dug-out canoes.  The Livingstone Museum is the best place to visit for an overview of the history of Victoria. Also try to fit in a guided walk to a local village to learn more about the way of life in the communities that live in the remote riverine forests.   Victoria Falls is once again a boom town. This is largely a combination of how much it has to offer and the fact that the USD/Zimbabwe Dollar exchange rate makes it highly affordable for foreigners. You can explore Victoria Falls on foot, on a bicycle, in a canoe or on a river boat, on the back of an elephant or on an open safari vehicle. End your day with High Tea at the historic Victoria Falls Hotel or join the party at one of the many vibey bars and nightclubs in town.
