Jeffrey Muvundusi in BULAWAYO  YOUNG artist Tyrese Maseko, has moved to tackle Covid-19 among children through the production of educational puppet shows. Ever since the outbreak of the pandemic, Maseko has produced five skits all of which are five minutes long each. “I do kids edutainment and ventriloquism through puppets and cool cat costumes, it’s something that I enjoy doing. I am glad to point out that after the outbreak of the pandemic, I felt it was wise for me to use my talent to educate the children between the age of nine months and 15 years old about the disease which has wreaked havoc the world over,” Maseko said. Maseko’s skits go by the name Uncle Tyrese and Friends. He has since his debut show in 2012 produced 43 videos which tackle various themes. “I write a script, edit and perform by myself while changing voices. Of course here and there I need an assistant,” he said. Though he is yet to break through on the mainstream television or online showcases, Maseko said he has since engaged the ZTV for a possible airing of his skits.  “I have engaged officials at ZBC and they are interested in my stuff although they indicated that there won’t be any funding for them. As a result if all goes well, kids shall be able to soon watch the programmes on television,” he said.
