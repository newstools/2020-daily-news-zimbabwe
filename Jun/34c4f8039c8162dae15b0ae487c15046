Vasco Chaya LIFESTYLE WRITER chayav@dailynews.co.zw  ZORA musician Leonard Zhakata has released a new single off his forthcoming studio album as a way to celebrate his 52nd birthday. Zhakata was born on June 25, 1968. “To share the birthday joy with our fans, we have a new single called Musandityira (I Am a Fighter),” he said. The song Musandityira (I Am a Fighter) was taken from his forthcoming studio album titled Mupendero Wenguva which is expected on the market shelves after the coronavirus national lockdown. “Being of the old school, I believe in physical interaction with fans, so I have planned to launch the album after the lockdown,” he said. Zhakata told the Daily News he is surviving owing to God’s grace. “Turning 52 is a testimony of God’s grace. There is no other secret for life apart from God’s mercy, favour and generosity. Kurarama Inyasha,” he said. Over the years, Zhakata usually celebrates his birthdays in Kadoma but this time around, he is at home in line with Covid-19 regulations. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); Zhakata became the youngest Zimbabwean musicians to sell more than 100 000 copies of an album at the age of 26 after his smash hit Maruva Enyika sold more than 120 000 copies. The all-time hit album Maruva Enyika in 1994 propelled Zhakata to stardom and since then he remained a force to reckon with in the music industry. Some of his music albums include Unochemei, Vagoni Vebasa, Upenyu Mutoro, Nzombe Huru, Mubikira, Zvangu Zvaita, Gotwe and Mutunga Dzose  among others. In 2016, Zhakata shocked all and sundry after three of his songs Madam Boss, Zvine Mwaka and Mwoyo Wekutenda off Mutunga Dzose clinched first, second and third position on Radio Zimbabwe Coca-Cola Top 50, a development that earned him the entire US$6 000 that was on offer. Zhakata grew up in Glen Norah, one of Harare’s high density suburbs, and recorded his first single Moyo Muti in 1989.
