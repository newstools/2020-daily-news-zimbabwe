MUSIC promotion company Kayse Connect, known for organising the Patoranking Harare concert last year, has lined up major gigs this year despite the on-going coronavirus national lockdown. The gigs confirmed so far include that of Burna Boy, the Euphoric Grooves featuring the urban grooves musicians, Strings Attached and the Worship Experience which is to be headlined by South African gospel sensation Benjamin Dube among others. The Burna Boy gig was initially scheduled for April but was postponed indefinitely due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Worship Experience Concert was introduced last year and saw a cast of local gospel musicians including Janet Manyowa, Takesure Zamar, Mambo Dhuterere and Baba naAmai Charamba among others sharing the stage. The next edition of the concert will be headlined by Dube on January 1. “The journey from our inception has been a great and eye-opening one. It is full of highs and quite a few lows, but even in those highs we still have learnt that quality is a constant need for the audience. Therefore we strive to continue building our brand so that each moment brings a whole different experience altogether,” he said.
