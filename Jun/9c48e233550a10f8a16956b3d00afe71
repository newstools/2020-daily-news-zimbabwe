matarutseg@dailynews.co.zwTHE arrival of the remains of the late Freddy “Pasuwa” Mugadza has been delayed after his family failed to secure a connecting flight from London, England to Harare.  Initially, Mugadza’s remains were supposed to have arrived in Harare yesterday afternoon from Atlanta, United States where he succumbed to pneumonia on April 10.  His elder brother Philip, who is a former DeMbare chairperson, confirmed the latest developments.   The Harare businessman said he was grateful to the football fraternity and all those who helped in repatriating his younger brother’s remains from the United States.  The situation was also complicated due to the fact that Mugadza passed away at the height of the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak in the United States.  His family could not travel to Atlanta where he was running a self-service laundry business to expedite the funeral arrangements and repatriation of his body back home.  Another prominent Dynamos supporter Chris “Romario” Musekiwa was at the forefront of the fundraising campaign to help the Mugadza family.  “I’m short of words. As a family we are really grateful to everyone, who has chipped in making sure the body of my brother returns home,” Philip said.  “We could not have done it alone. I’m sure you are aware of his Facebook page ‘Freddy Pasuwa Mugadza’ and they helped us with some money. It was a really expensive process and we are really grateful.”  During his time whilst in Zimbabwe, he was known as a passionate DeMbare fan with then midfielder Kalisto Pasuwa his favourite player.  Those days, Mugadza, achieved notoriety for his violent clashes with opposing fans of different teams.
He also had many running battles with sports journalists, who dared to cover his misdemeanours in the stands.  To his credit though, Mugadza later on matured to become one of the most influential football fans in local football despite having migrated to the United States in 2006.
