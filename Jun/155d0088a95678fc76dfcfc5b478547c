matarutseg@dailynews.co.zw AS THE South African Absa Premiership awaits resumption, Kaizer Chiefs assistant coach Shaun Bartlett has taken time to shower praises on former Warriors skipper Willard Katsande for his influence in the Amakhosi dressing room. Katsande has flourished at Amakhosi since his arrival in 2011, a year after he burst into the Super Diski following his switch from local side Gunners to Ajax Cape Town. The former Warriors skipper has since notched close to 300 appearances for Kaizer Chiefs while claiming the captain’s armband in this current campaign, in the absence of Itumeleng Khune, who was previously injured and has since been dislodged by Daniel Akpeyi. The 34-year-old has been one of the outstanding players this season guiding the Phefeni Glamour Boys to the top of the table before the campaign was halted by the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic leaving Bartlett in awe. “I think that’s the important thing, he is a leader, he is a core player, he is one of the more experienced players we have in the squad,” Bartlett told Kaizer Chiefs TV. “Everyone looks at Katsande and the first thing (they see) is his physicality and tackles but for us it is more his tactical discipline, how he holds the position, what he gives to us as a team and how he gives cover to the full backs when they go out of position.” There is hope that the current season in South Africa will resume after teams were allowed to go back to the training grounds recently. While some seasons around Europe and Africa have been cancelled, the PSL remains hopeful of completing the current campaign but meeting the July 31 deadline set by the league itself will be a challenge, especially because the players and officials are yet to be tested. The PSL has been suspended for at least three months due to the coronavirus outbreak coupled with the lockdown imposed by the government.
