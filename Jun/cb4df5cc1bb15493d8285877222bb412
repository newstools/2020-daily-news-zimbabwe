HARARE – Botswana-based Zimbabwean winger Eliphas Nyambi is relishing the restart of football in that country next month as he is looking forward to finish the season on a personal high. The Police XI winger was in terrific form before the lockdown getting man of the match accolades on numerous occasions and getting on to the score-sheet eight times and four man-of-the-match awards in 14 games. Nyambi who has been on the books of Police XI for the past four years is itching to be the next Zimbabwean after former Harare United and ZPC Kariba midfielder Elvis Meleka to win the Botswana footballer of the year award. Meleka was the last Zimbabwean to win the award in while turning out for Mochudi Centre Chiefs in 2013 under Zimbabwean gaffer Madinda Ndlovu. “I was in good form before the Covid-19 induced break but I’m looking forward to the resumption of the league and finish off the business. This is my fourth season playing in the topflight league I guess my performance has largely been inspired more by the confidence I now have given the amount of time I have spent in the same division,” Nyambi told the Daily News yesterday. “As a team we are looking forward to bagging the FA Cup and the league. We were on position five when the league was disrupted but just seven points adrift of the log leaders so I’m confident we will be able to turn the tables around when we go through the last phase of our season soon.” The former DC Academy and Black Mambas player now aged 24 is also hopeful of a Warriors’ call up given how he has gone about his business on the field for the police outfit. “It’s every player’s dream to represent their country at national team level. I believe my performance can speak better on my behalf and should the selectors and technical team come-calling I am more than ready to step on the international stage,” he said.
