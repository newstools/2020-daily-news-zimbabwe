PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa has implored Zimbabweans to remain wary of Covid-19, warning that the lethal virus was still a threat to the country, the Daily News reports. Speaking at the burial of national hero, Ruphus Chigudu, at the National Heroes Acre in Harare yesterday, Mnangagwa said complacency in fighting the virus could lead to disaster. This comes as coronavirus continues to cause havoc in the world, with United States of America president Donald Trump being the latest high profile person to contract the disease. It also comes as Zimbabwe is now recording less deaths and numbers of people infected by the deadly virus. “The novel coronavirus is still with us. Don’t be mistaken. We must not allow complacency to trigger a relapse. “We value life above all else. Voting and democracy are enjoyed by the living not the sick, dying or the dead,” Mnangagwa told the mourners yesterday. Zimbabwe is under an 8pm to dawn curfew introduced when cases of Covid-19 began rising sharply as the virus spread rapidly then. The disease has killed more than 200 people, including former Lands, Agriculture, Water and Rural Resettlement minister Perrance Shiri. Shiri, a former war veteran and military commander — born Bigboy Samson Chikerema before he joined the liberation war in the 1970s — endured a difficult and lonely death in his car, as he tried in vain to drive himself to a hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, Mnangagwa has also pleaded with Zimbabweans to remain united and shun violence. “Given the onslaught, machinations and clandestine shenanigans by our detractors, isu tasara, ngatirambei takabatana (we the living must remain united) … in defence of our hard-won independence. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); “Violence, destruction of property and making Zimbabwe ungovernable can never be democratic and that is not what we fought for,” he further told the mourners. Mnangagwa also raised concerns over rising cases of armed robbery and ritual murders of minors in the country. “Government is concerned about growing cases of ritual murders of minors. Let me reiterate that all stakeholders in our criminal justice system must speedily and firmly deal with the perpetrators so that this evil trend is expunged from our society. “We must draw lessons and inspirations from the late brigadier general … Chigudu whose profession was founded on use of firearms, who knew that guns are for the defence and protection of national interest, unlike others in our midst who turn against their own nation … due to lack of principle. “I have ordered our security arms to deal with such misdeeds,” Mnangagwa said.
