 THE police are hunting for 10 armed notorious robbers who allegedly caused havoc, robbing a number of motorists along Beitbridge-Dite Road. In a statement yesterday, police spokesperson Paul Nyathi said the robbers committed the crimes on Tuesday. “The Zimbabwe Republic Police has launched a manhunt for 10 unknown armed robbers who attacked eight motorists on 27 October, 2020 along Beitbridge-Dite Road around 2200hrs. “A motorist in a Nissan Caravan with one passenger on board found the road blocked with large stones at the 10km peg along the said road and he got out to remove the stones. “Ten men wearing face masks and balaclavas, armed with pistols and rifles attacked them by firing at their vehicle. They stole cell-phones, cash and clothes from the duo,” Nyathi said. According to the police, another motorist arrived at the scene and the robbers also shot at his vehicle, puncturing his front tyres. “The motorist drove off, abandoned the vehicle and sought help. “Other motorists arrived and shone their lights on the robbers, but they sneaked behind… and opened fire. The motorists fled and left their vehicles, two Toyota Granvias, two Nissan Caravans and an Isuzu Como kombi. “The armed robbers then ransacked the vehicles, stealing cash, groceries and other property yet to be established. They then fled from the scene. “Police are appealing to anyone who may have information pertaining to these dangerous robbers to report at any nearest police station or national complaints desk,” Nyathi added. This comes as the police continue to record an increase in armed robbers and recently. The police have also warned the public against boarding unregistered vehicles as robbers were now using them to steal from the public. Sponsored Links
