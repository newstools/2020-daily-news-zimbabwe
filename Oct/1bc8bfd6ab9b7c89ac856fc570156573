  MUSICIAN and dancer Lyn Magodo, popularly known as Lady Storm or simply Eriza says she has moved on after her divorce early this year from Tinarwo Gotora (Mukanya).
The divorce was hard for her as it happened just as the Covid-19 hit and with Mukanya who was the bread winner gone, she had to find other means to fend for their baby. Her appearance in Jah Prayzah’s hit video Eriza propelled her artistic career. Last week, Daily News on Sunday’s Vasco Chaya met her in Harare and discussed an array of issues including working in a maledominated industry.
Below are excerpts from the interview:-
Q. Most people know Lady Storm from Jah Prayzah’s hit video Eriza which earned you the moniker Eriza; can you
briefly tell us about your life before the video Eriza.
A. I was born Lyn Magodo in Kwekwe. I attended Inkomo Secondary School and my father was a soldier. After completing secondary education, I served in the army for three years before resigning on medical grounds, I have ulcers. As I grew up loving music and dancing, I thought of taking it professionally after I resigned from the
army. I recorded my debut studio album entitled Usandibate with the assistance of well-wishers. I was
given US$800 for the project. That was how I ventured into music. I then started to stage concerts in and
around Harare. Just like my name, Storm, I just stormed into the industry. It was like a storm! My first concert was when I shared the stage with Slizer during a Tongai Moyo commemoration gig. One day, I was invited to curtain raise Jah Prayzah; I think he was impressed by my dancing skills but he did not comment about it. After some days, he contacted me asking me to feature in the video Eriza off the album Jerusarema. The video was shot in Kuwadzana and Lusaka in Highfield in Harare and it was a hit and it also propelled me to stardom.
Q. You joined the showbiz at a young age. Can you tell us about your experiences with promoters and other industry
stakeholders?
A. The industry is dominated by men and it is obvious that unscrupulous promoters always chase the new and fresh entries (ladies). They (men) were always after me but I thank God I was always moving in the company of my ex-husband Tinarwo Gotora (Mukanya) hence they respected me like that.
Q. What really happened between you and Mukanya?
A. The marriage was on the rocks for a long time. It was characterised by problems. When we had the baby, he doubted that he was the father. We did everything possible to ascertain the paternity of the child and it all pointed to him as the father. After that, I thought we were happy only to witness him walking away from our matrimonial home, leaving me with the child early this year. Yes, it affected me but you know life has to go on. Now we are talking as the baby’s parents and he is supporting the child. But, I do not see ourselves getting back together again as parents or lovers considering the pains he inflicted on me during our stay together.
Q. What lessons have you learnt from the divorce and by any chance do you regret some of your actions during
your stay in the course of the marriage?
A. Life is too short. I learnt a lot in life generally though I am not at liberty to mention all the lessons here but I regret the time I spent quarrelling with baba Chloe (Mukanya) during our stay together. If I had managed to avoid this, I think I would have more good memories than bad ones.
Q. What were you doing during the lockdown and how were you surviving?
A. It was a challenging experience for me to say the least. Remember Mukanya was the breadwinner and when he walked away that was the time Covid-19 lockdown was put in place. However, there is a solution to every problem. I was introduced into an online business where we buy goods from China and sell them here in Zimbabwe and the profits are good. My popularity gives me a competitive advantage in this business. So, basically that is what I am doing right now apart from music.
Q. You are still young, is there a new guy in your life?
A. I am still single and not searching. After all, no one is coming mainly because they think Mukanya
is still in charge (laughs). Remember, my life is an open book and everyone knows about Mukanya. I think
that is the reason why I am still single without anyone in place.
Q. Back to your career, who is your favourite musician and why?
A. Locally, I love Baba Shero (Alick Macheso). Apart from his unquestionable talent, he is more of a father to me. During the course of my divorce, he helped me a lot both financially and morally until I managed to get over it. On an international scale, I am a rhumba person hence I am for Koffi Olomide and Fally Ipupa.
Q. Can you share with us your plans in the music industry?
A. I have a new single called Wazodi Paye Paye which I wrote way back during my stay with Mukanya. He even helped me to perfect some of the lyrics on the song. So, I am working on the video of the song which I intend to release in a few weeks to come. This song talks about what happened in my life (marriage wise) though I wrote it before the divorce.
