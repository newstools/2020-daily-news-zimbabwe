Mugove Tafirenyika  HEALTH experts warned authorities yesterday against rushing to ease coronavirus restrictions further without ensuring citizens’ safety, saying this could lead to a second wave of the killer disease in the country, the Daily News reports. This comes after President Emmerson Mnangagwa also implored Zimbabweans on Monday to remain vigilant, warning that the lethal virus was still a threat to the country. Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, the health experts welcomed Mnangagwa’s timely reminder about the threat still posed by Covid-19, but said authorities needed to tighten restrictions to avoid another wave of the virus in the country. The secretary-general of the Senior Hospital Doctors Association (SHDA), Aaron Musara, was among those who cautioned against the wholesale reopening of the economy. The president of the Zimbabwe Nurses Association (Zina), Enock Dongo, said authorities needed to enforce compliance by citizens to adhere to all protocols such as sanitising and maintaining social distance. “It is true that before a vaccine is found we cannot afford to let our guard down. It is important for us, with our weak public health system, to always be alert and continue to put on our masks, washing our hands and maintaining social distance,” Chonzi told the Daily News. This comes as Mnangagwa has warned Zimbabweans to remain on guard against the killer virus, which has infected millions around the world. Speaking at the burial of national hero Ruphus Chigudu at the National Heroes Acre in Harare on Monday, Mnangagwa said complacency in fighting the virus could lead to disaster. Zimbabwe is still under an 8pm-to-dawn curfew introduced when cases of Covid-19 began rising sharply as the virus spread rapidly then. The disease has so far killed more than 200 people, including former Lands, Agriculture, Water and Rural Resettlement minister Perrance Shiri. Last week, United States of America president Donald Trump became the latest high profile person to contract the disease. Sponsored Links
