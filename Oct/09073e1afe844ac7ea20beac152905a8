  SOUTH Africa’s Health minister Zweli Mkhize announced 61 more Covid-19 related deaths and 2 019 new infections on Friday night.
This takes South Africa’s Covid-19 death toll to 18 370, and infections to over 700 203. The number of recoveries in
the country stands at 629 260, which accounts for nine out of every 10 people infected with the virus recovering from it. South Africa has the 11th most Covid-19 infections in the world, with the USA, Brazil, India, Russia, Spain, Columbia, Argentina, Peru, Mexico and France having the most cases in the world. The USA has over 8
million cases, the highest in the world. In South Africa, new infections are slowing, but Mkhize has again warned about the dangers of a second wave and urged people to continue social distancing and wearing masks. He said that the second wave would arrive if people were complacent and did not wear masks and practice social distancing. The Department of Health said it had now tested over 4,4 million people in the private and public sector, with almost 24 000 tests conducted in the past 24 hours. The Gauteng province has the most deaths, with 4 601, followed by the Western Cape, with 4 280, Eastern Cape with 3 411 and KZN, with 3 122. Of the latest 61 deaths, Mkhize said the majority were in the Free State. Deaths by province:
* Free State — 21, including two people in the last 48 hours
* Eastern Cape — 14
* KZN — 11
* Northern Cape — 11
* Gauteng — Four, including three people in the last 48 hours. “We extend our condolences to the loved ones of the departed and thank the healthcare workers that treated the deceased patients,” said Mkhize. — IOL Sponsored Links
