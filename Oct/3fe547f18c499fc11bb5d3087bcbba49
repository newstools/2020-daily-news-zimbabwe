FORMER Cabinet minister Nicholas Goche, who was later expelled from the ruling Zanu PF, yesterday appeared before a Bindura magistrate after he was arrested for allegedly stealing 18 heifers worth US$18 000.
The former political heavyweight and secretary for transport in the Zanu PF politburo was arrested on Wednesday and spent the night in police custody. He was not asked to plead to the charges that he is facing when he appeared before Bindura magistrate Tendai Chifamba — who remanded the former diplomat to October 21 on $50 000 bail. As part of the bail conditions, Chifamba ordered Goche to surrender his passport, report every Friday
at Shamva Police Station, continue to reside at his farm and not to interfere with witnesses and investigations until the case is finalised. The complainant in the matter is Honest Mupanedengu,43, from Harare. The court heard that in November 2018, Goche allegedly sold 40 beasts to Mupanedengu, who paid for the beasts in full through a bank transfer. Mupanedengu is said to have collected 22 steers of the 40 beasts, leaving behind 18. “On a date … unknown, but during the year 2019, the accused disposed of all the 18 steers without the knowledge of the complainant. “The complainant approached the accused on diverse occasions to collect the 18 heifers, but the accused indicated that he had sold the heifers. Total value stolen is US$18 000 and nothing has been recovered,”
the State claims. Goche was fired from Cabinet by the late former President Robert Mugabe in the run-up to Zanu PF’s sham 2014 congress. He was sacked together with other bigwigs such as Mugabe’s former deputy Joice Mujuru and  ex-Presidential Affairs minister Didymus Mutasa — over untested allegations of plotting to topple from power the late strongman. Apart from Goche and Mutasa, the other ministers fired then were Webster Shamu, Francis Nhema, Olivia Muchena, Dzikamai Mavhaire, Simbaneuta Mudarikwa and Munacho Mutezo. Mugabe also cut loose Sylvester Nguni who was then Minister of State in Mujuru’s office. Sponsored Links
