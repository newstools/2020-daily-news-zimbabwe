 PREPARATIONS for the inaugural Zimbabwe Miss Tourism World pageant are underway, with organisers now in the selection process.
The pageant’s public relations manager, Lauren Grave, said 24/7 Entertainment in conjunction with Channel D
will be hosting the Zimbabwe Miss Tourism World 2020 finals on November 21 at a venue that is yet to be announced. “The Zimbabwe Miss Tourism World finals will be held in Harare at a venue to be announced soon. The finals will have 15 contestants chosen countrywide from three auditions in Harare, Gweru and Bulawayo,” she said. “The winner of the pageant will represent Zimbabwe at the Miss Tourism World finals to be held in China
in December organised by Taiwan-based Golden International Corporation.” Owing to Covid-19 regulations, applications will be done online. “There are application forms on our Facebook and Whatsapp platforms. Applicants must be aged between 21 and 24 with a minimum height of 1,73m, beautiful and intelligent.” Grave said there will be enough security for the models. “…24/7 Entertainment will make sure that the models are fully protected by providing security details at all the events and during boot camp. Due to Covid-19 prevention regulations the boot camp will be conducted in
a bio-bubble environment,” Grave said. The pageant comes after President Emmerson Mnangagwa launched the Visit Zimbabwe Promotion
Campaign which seeks to leverage on the tourism sector to market the country as a premier tourist destination.
“In this regard, 24/7 Entertainment will partner with Zimbabwe Tourism Authority through its parent Tourism
and Hospitality Industry ministry to help market Zimbabwe as a premier tourist destination. “The winner will be a tourism brand ambassador for Zimbabwe as she competes in China,” she said. Sponsored Links
