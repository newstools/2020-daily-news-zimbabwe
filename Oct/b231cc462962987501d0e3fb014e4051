 Vasco Chaya LIFESTYLE WRITER chayav@dailynews.co.zw HIP-HOP star Calvin Nhliziyo popularly known as Cal_Vin died in a hit and run car accident yesterday in Luveve, Bulawayo plunging the music industry into mourning. He was involved in a hit and run car accident near his home in Luveve 5 in the wee hours of yesterday while on his way from watching a soccer match at Emakhandeni Cricket Club. He was 35. “The gift of being able to wake up every day is so underrated and if you are reading this be grateful for being alive…2020 has taken so many greats away from us. Rest in peace Cal_vin,” Simuka Comedy said. Highlanders Football Club expressed their condolence message on social media as the late Zkhuphan hit-maker was one of their staunch supporters. “Condolences to the Nhliziyo family and society in general for the sad loss of Calvin Mgcini Nhliziyo. Besides being a great artist, he was a staunch Bosso fan, who has left a void within the greater Bosso family. You will always be remembered, rest easy King Cal Vin,” reads the post from Highlanders. Opposition political party MDC Alliance also expressed their condolences through social media. “The MDC Alliance extends its condolences to the Nhliziyo family and the hip-hop community on the untimely passing of Mgcini Calvin Nhliziyo…That Luveve Boy. As a party that champions the arts, we are deeply saddened to have lost a young, talented musician. May he rest in peace.” The fallen hip-hop star, also known as That Luveve Boy, somehow united political parties through his death. Zanu PF Patriots, a social media group made up of staunch Zanu PF supporters also took to Facebook announcing the death of the star. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');});  “Bulawayo-based rapper Cal_Vin has died. The renowned superstar passed away this morning (Sunday) near his house in Luveve in an accident. Cal_Vin is reported to have been involved in a hit-and-run accident. May his soul rest in eternal peace!” Fellow hip-hop musician Mudiwa Mutandwa was speechless. “Rest in peace King. Ndashaiwa mazwi (I’ve run out of words).” Cal_Vin was one of the few brave musicians in the country to stand up for his music rights. This comes after the deceased barred Sky Metro FM from playing his music and the radio station based in Bulawayo responded with a blanket blackout of the musician. However, the feud that existed between Cal_Vin and Sky Metro FM was resolved after the intervention of the Voluntary Media Council of Zimbabwe in September. At the height of his dominance of Zim Hip-Hop, Cal_Vin increasingly became frustrated with “useless beef” that characterised the genre. “Rappers in 2017, let’s beef, brag and be different. I personally want to see more verified accounts, more videos, million views on YouTube, sold out hip-hop shows, Niggaz getting real music money (not bringing family wealth into the game and using it to provoke others). “I want to see more international collaborations and international bookings. I am just basically saying-old ways of hating each other shouldn’t be allowed this year. Let us provoke each other progressively. We can’t have too many rappers tweeting / Facebooking their dominance/supremacy yet they are not able to take care of their families,” Cal_vin told the Daily News at the end of 2016. Sponsored Links
