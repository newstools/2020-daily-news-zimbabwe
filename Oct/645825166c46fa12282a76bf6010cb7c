Mugove Tafirenyika SENIOR STAFF WRITER tafirenyikam@dailynews.co.zw Police immediately charged him with inciting public violence, following his alleged role in mobilising for the foiled anti-government protests in July. His lawyer, Harrison Nkomo, said the forthright former Zanu PF bigwig — who now leads the anti-corruption pressure group, the Front for Economic Emancipation (FEE) — would appear in court today. Tsenengamu’s arrest follows the charging of some of the other alleged July 31 demo leaders such as Jacob Ngarivhume and MDC Alliance deputy national chairperson Job “Wiwa” Sikhala — who are both out on bail. “Today … I have come out and walked into Harare Central Police Station to engage with the … authorities at Harare Central Police Station’s Law and Order section, as I seek to physically make enquiries with the ZRP in a bid to understand and seek closure to what has been happening to me, my family, relatives and friends for the past three months. “I am fully aware of the imminent risks and dangers that come with this decision and also the possibilities of unpleasant outcomes to my health, safety and life in the short and long term. “However, I trust and believe in God the Almighty as the final and ultimate authority above all, for he has a plan and reason for everything that comes our way,” Tsenengamu had announced earlier on social media yesterday. When he went into hiding, Tsenengamu claimed that his life was in danger following several visits by suspected State agents at both of his residences in Harare and Bindura. Since his expulsion from Zanu PF over allegations of corruption that he made against some ruling party bigwigs, Tsenengamu has become an arch critic of President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his government. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); In August, after security forces had foiled the planned July demos, he said only genuine national dialogue would ease tensions and help to resolve the nation’s myriad challenges. “It is very unfortunate that authorities have decided to descend heavily on citizens for speaking out. I thought they would engage with citizens and hear out their concerns, but sadly we are being treated like terrorists. “I think the authorities must reconsider their position on dissenting voices. That is the only sustainable way to address this. “In the same way that authorities have re-engaged and engaged with the international community and the victims of the Gukurahundi disturbances in order to find common ground, they must also consider engaging with all,” Tsenengamu told the Daily News from his hideout then.
