 Vasco Chaya LIFESTYLE WRITER chaya@dailynews.co.zw CITY Link Coaches has partnered Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) to promote domestic tourism. This comes as the government recently opened the tourism sector to operate during the on-going Covid-19-induced national lockdown. As a result, the transporter has introduced weekly trips to tourist attraction centres with Harare – Chinhoyi trip scheduled for November 7 being the first. City Link human resources and administration manager Nobuhle Gwemende said the idea is to take people to various tourist destinations. “Zimbabweans should know their country better. We have started with Chinhoyi  Caves tour; Harare to Chinhoyi this Saturday and the response from the market will guide us either to continue or stop but we are looking forward to getting a good response,” said Gwemende. City Link is offering a day package of transport from Harare to Chnhoyi and back; Chinhoyi Caves tour, lion viewing, picnic braai and DJ entertainment. ZimParks spokesperson Tinashe Farawo said: “The partnership serves to promote and develop the country through tourism. We are moving in line with President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s vision of seeing the country rising again to be a giant in the region economically,” Farawo said adding that the partnership will go a long way in building the country. “The money raised from domestic tourism will be used to look after our animals in various game parks.” Meanwhile, City Link is also looking forward to reviving the Harare to Victoria Falls package. “We used to offer the package (Harare to Victoria Falls) before the national coronavirus lockdown and we are looking forward to reviving the package to boost our domestic tourism,” Gwemende said. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');});  Gwemende said her organisation is flexible to adjust the package to suit their clients’ demands. “We are here to offer a service to the people hence we are always flexible to tailor make the package to suit their demands.” According to the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority’s spokesperson Godfrey Koti, the country could have lost between US$1 billion during the close of national coronavirus lockdown when the government closed down the tourism sector among other economic sectors to curb the spread of the deadly virus.
