Blessing Masakadza STAFF WRITER masakadzab@dailynews.co.zw  PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa yesterday set up two tribunals to investigate the fitness for office of one Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc) member, Frank Muchengwa, and two commissioners of the Zimbabwe Land Commission (ZLC), Tadious Muzoroza and Jeanette Marrie Manjengwa. In an extraordinary Government Gazette yesterday, Mnangagwa appointed retired High Court judge Justice Nicholas Ndou, Justice ministry permanent secretary Virginia Mabhiza and lawyers Tarisai Mutangi and Tecla Mapota to enquire into the fitness to hold office of Muchengwa after he was recently suspended for alleged graft at Zacc. Ndou will chair the four-member tribunal. Mnangagwa said the tribunal will be held from the date of the swearing in of its members. The tribunal was set up “to investigate into the matter of the removal from office of … Muchengwa, investigate into the matter of … Muchengwa’s conduct, whether it can be deemed to be tantamount to gross misconduct.” The tribunal will also “investigate whether … Muchengwa interfered with the course of justice during the conduct of his duties and investigate whether … Muchengwa interfered with investigations, received bribes and passed on confidential information concerning matters that he was investigating.” On the ZLC issue, Mnangagwa appointed retired Justice Misheck Cheda, Mabhiza, Telecel boss Angeline Vere and lawyer Godfrey Mutseyekwa to inquire into the question of removal from office of deputy chairperson of the commission Muzoroza and commissioner Manjengwa. The tribunal will investigate among other issues: “Whether the conduct of … Muzoroza and … Manjengwa … amounted to gross misconduct’’. The tribunals will also recommend if the two are fit to continue holding office. Sponsored Links
