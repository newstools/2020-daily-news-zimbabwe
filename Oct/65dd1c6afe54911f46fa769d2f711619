Vasco Chaya ORGANISERS of the annual musical event, Change a Life Concert, on Friday brought cheers to Melfort Old People’s Home in Mashonaland East Province. The home received groceries from the Alfred Dondo Foundation (ADF), which is behind the annual musical showcase to cushion vulnerable senior citizens from the effects of the coronavirus (Covid-19)-induced lockdown. “It is always good to have people who can stretch their hands, helping the elderly and under privileged people, especially during this lockdown period where everyone is minding his or her own business. We really appreciate it,” the Melfort Old People’s Home administration manager Francis Daniel said. One of the residents at the home, Blunt Jamba, originally from Mozambique is believed to be aged 102. Melfort Old People’s Home is situated about 50km out of Harare, along the Mutare Road. Some of the occupants at this home are referrals from the Social Welfare Department while others would have been dumped in Harare and Marondera hospitals. The home has a capacity to accommodate 60 people but currently it has about 30. The number dropped due to unfortunate circumstances such as inmate deaths and lack of consistent food supply among others. “The main problem that we face is food shortages. If we fail to get a donation, we face problems. We need at least 300kg of meal-meal per month, 11 litres of cooking oil, among other things depending on the number of people resident at that particular time,” he said. Prior to the donation, ADF assisted Zimdancehall chanter Micho Bachoe with a wheelchair and groceries, among other goodies, in Chitungwiza last week. Over the years, the ADF has helped marginalised people through the concert but this time around, the event hangs in the balance owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. The foundation looks after at least 65 vulnerable people mainly in Chikomba and Sadza districts of Chivhu.   The previous edition of the concert featured top-notch musicians such as Nasty C from South Africa, Davido from Nigeria and local musicians King98, Tamy Moyo and Ex Q among others. Sponsored Links
