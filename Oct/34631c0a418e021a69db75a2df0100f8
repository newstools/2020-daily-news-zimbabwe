 VICE-PRESIDENT Constantino Chiwenga, also Zimbabwe’s Health minister, has unveiled an ambitious plan to establish ground and air ambulance services as part of the government’s efforts to resuscitate the country’s ailing
health system, the Daily News reports.
The plan is a component of Chiwenga’s restructuring strategy that will result in the health delivery system being anchored on four pillars — including pharmaceutical and biomedical engineering. Addressing delegates during the handover of three ambulances donated by Redan Coupon to the Health ministry
in Harare yesterday, Chiwenga said the resuscitation of the country’s public ambulance service would
ensure that patients get critical health attention on time.  “The three ambulances donated by Redan Coupon Private Limited will provide services at Gwanda, Masvingo and Marondera provincial hospitals, and also service the highways when road traffic accidents occur. “My ministry’s vision for ambulance services is to ensure that when a life threatening situation arises, patients can reach a health facility within two hours. “This will require a ground fleet of at least 200 fully equipped ambulances and this will also require air ambulances in case the distance does not allow for a road or surface ambulance. “As we strive to achieve a prosperous and empowered upper middle class society by 2030, we take heed of the World Health Organisation’s adage that health workers are productive and they raise healthy families,” Chiwenga said. Recently, Cabinet approved the introduction of a strategy involving nine divisions in the health sector — including research biomedical engineering, biomedical science, bio-pharmaceutical engineering and production, logistics
and assets management, and curative services. “The restructured Ministry of Health and Child Care will comprise, among other entities, a directorate of ambulance services comprising ground and air ambulance departments. “The ambulances will be combined with helicopters and will be used to evacuate people in life threatening situations to the nearest appropriate health facilities. “The surface ambulances will be stationed at
health institutions around the country and also along the country’s major highways,” Chiwenga
said. He called on the international community and other development partners to assist the ministry’s drive to
rebuild the country’s health services. Sponsored Links
