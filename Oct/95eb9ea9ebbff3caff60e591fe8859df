 Vasco Chaya LIFESTYLE WRITER chayav@dailynews.co.zw COMEDIAN and singer Freddy “Kapfupi” Manjalima has collaborated with his wife, Mai Ngaa on a new single. The track, still to be named, is expected soon. “We are grooming her to be a complete musician. She first collaborated with Kapfupi on the single Sadza Nezondo and the forthcoming track is going to be her second studio project,” Orchestra Ndoozvo band manager Sam Manjalima told the Daily News. Mai Ngaa, real name Precious Kabrito, hogged showbiz limelight a decade ago after featuring on Kapfupi’s music video titled Mai Ngaa. Since then, Mai Ngaa became an integral part of the Orchestra Ndoozvo Band. She and Kapfupi have five children, with the last born named after his comedian-cum-musician father. Musically, Kapfupi is arguably one the best sungura artistes in the country, thanks to the influence of the late superstar Oliver “Tuku” Mtukudzi. Manjalima started his arts career two decades ago, performing in street theatres in the capital. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });  At first people did not take his music seriously, judging from the funny character he played in his comedies and series of dramas which were screened by the sole national television ZBC. In 2010 his hit song Mai Ngaa was the outstanding song at the National Arts Merit Awards (Nama) with the album Juice Card being nominated among the outstanding albums alongside sungura ace Alick Macheso and the dancehall heavyweight Winky D. If she (Mai Ngaa) carves out her own solo music career, she will join the list of wives of popular musicians such as Olivia Charamba and Selmor Mtukudzi. Sponsored Links
