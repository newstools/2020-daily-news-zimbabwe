matongoreren@dailynews.co.zwENGLISH Championship side Queens Park Rangers (QPR) have paid at least £2 million to secure the services of Warriors forward Macauley Bonne from League One side Charlton Athletic yesterday.The 24-year-old forward signed a three-year deal with the former Premier League side with an option to extend the deal by a further 12 months.QPR had been aggressive in their pursuit of the Zimbabwean in the last three weeks and had two previous bids rejected by Charlton.After finally getting their top target, QPR manager Mark Warburton is looking forward to working with Bonne.“I am delighted to have him on board. Macauley has already shown himself to be a proven goalscorer at this level, and he did it with a team in the lower half of the division.“He can score a variety of goals, he’s young, hungry and has a lot of development potential in him. He will help to lighten the load for Lyndon Dykes and will certainly give us a different option up front,” Warburton told the QPR website after the deal was announced.Speaking after the conclusion of the deal, Bonne said he had set sights on helping fire QPR back into the top flight.“I am really pleased and happy it’s finally done. I can’t wait to get started now.
“The second I heard there was interest, my head was turned. I’ll easily say that — my head was turned straight away.
“When you look at someone like Ebere Eze, the manager here and the club must be doing something right to develop players into Premier League players,” Bonne told the QPR TV yesterday.It has been a whirlwind last few years for the Zimbabwean as he was playing in the fifth tier of English football for Leyton Orient two seasons ago.Bonne scored 45 goals in 90 appearances as he helped fire Leyton to promotion from the National League into League Two.After that good showing, the Zimbabwean began to attract interest from all over and it was Charlton, who secured his services from Leyton for only £200 000 last season.In his debut campaign in the Championship, Bonne scored 11 goals — 12 in all competitions last season triggering interest from a host of Premier League and Championship teams.Although Charlton suffered relegation, Bonne’s impressive goal tally after jumping three divisions was an indication of his talent.“I was thrown in and had to deal with it — there’s no thinking about it. Once you get thrown in you have to take your chances.“I am happy and proud of where I have come from to get to where I am today,” he added.
Meanwhile, Charlton manager Lee Bowyer said they had no option but to accept QPR’s bid for Bonne because it was good business for the South London club.“What Macca has been is a pleasure to work with. He’s been a really good pro and he’s developed a lot from when we took him last season.“He has only been here a year and has developed a lot from the player who walked through the door.
“He has got a lot better and he works hard — that is what happens when you work hard, you then move on.
“It’s a great deal for the club. It’s good business — something we couldn’t turn down. The last thing the owner wants to do is come in and sell players but this is something we can’t refuse.“Macca is a great lad and has been very professional through all this. He has not come knocking on the door and saying: ‘Let me go’.“But he had told me that he would like to move on. He understood it had to be right for everybody and he just carried on — it’s been going on a little while. But he kept working hard. He is a nice lad.“We improve players, that’s what we do. That’s my job and in total I think it’s about £10m we have brought into the club since I’ve been in charge and we’ve only spent £275 000 — £200 000 of that on Macca,” Bowyer said.
