The latest album is expected to be launched on Nash TV tonight and Chari will be supported by musician Braveman Chizvino popularly known as Baba Harare. Chari hogged showbiz limelight in 2018 thanks to the popularity of his fourth album Mariyambutsa, a project that earned him Best Upcoming Artiste gong that year courtesy of Radio Zimbabwe Coca-Cola Top 50. The Chegutu-based musician told this publication that he was shocked by the positive response his hit song Mebo received on the market considering the project was recorded in a small farming town (Chegutu) where music promoters and public media are hard to come by. “I never marketed my music aggressively but to my surprise the song Mebo simply got the attention of fans from all corners of the country.  “It just went viral on social media sites. I can’t thank God enough for this,” he said. MEBO hit-maker Obert Chari will officially unveil his latest studio album entitled Ubuntu today. Sponsored Links
