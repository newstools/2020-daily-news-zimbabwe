mhlophes@dailynews.co.zw PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa has issued a chilling warning to opposition parties and individuals he accuses of plotting to topple his government through violence and delinquency, saying they have no place in the country and the southern African region, the Daily News reports.  This comes as State Security minister Owen Ncube earlier this week alleged that the opposition was part of a Western countries’ scheme to smuggle guns into the country to oust Mnangagwa and his regime.  It also comes a few weeks after authorities thwarted the July anti-government protest, amid accusations by local and international rights groups of human rights violations by security agents.  Speaking at a banquet for visiting Malawian President Lazarus Chakwera at State House, Harare, on Wednesday night, Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe was under constant attack from both external and internal forces seeking to topple his government and derail its international re-engagement policy.   “These sanctions were a direct response by Britain and her allies to Zimbabwe’s land reform programme in 1999/2000. We make no apologies for taking back our land and we are happy that the people have been reunited with their land.  “It has become very clear that these sanctions are designed to effect regime change. Hence, Zimbabwe continues to endure unrelenting attacks from external forces and their internal surrogates, with the intention of unconstitutionally, violently and illegally overthrowing our democratically elected government. Thankfully, our people have remained vigilant, astute and patriotic,” Mnangagwa said.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); “My government will not tire from entrenching democracy, constitutionalism and the rule of law. We shall remain steadfast in pursuing national unity, cohesion, peace, and harmony among our people. In this regard, the Political Actors Dialogue (Polad) established after the 2018 elections as the only inclusive and diverse platform for all political actors who contested the presidential elections, will proceed with promoting dialogue.  “Those who prefer confrontation, anarchy, delinquency, civil disobedience and the peddling of falsehoods in a bid to unseat democratically elected governments have no place in our country and indeed in our Sadc region,” he added.  Mnangagwa said Sadc’s rich heritage of regional solidarity should be guarded jealously and never sacrificed on the altar of the erstwhile forces’ hegemonic tendencies and expediences.   “As a result of this policy, the country has seen notable investments. Earlier today, I was pleased to launch a US$51 million Belarus farm mechanisation facility which will help improve efficiencies, production and productivity in our agriculture sector. In view of the centrality of agriculture to our two economies, and to Africa in general, we are confident that this initiative will go a long way towards enhancing food self-sufficiency.  “My administration has also undertaken a raft of socio-political reforms and is fighting the scourge of corruption to create a conducive business environment and improve the quality of life of our people. The success we are recording will set our country on an irreversible course to economic development and growth,” Mnangagwa said.  He congratulated Malawi for holding successful elections without international observers, while questioning the need for foreign witnesses.  “For the first time in our region, possibly in our continent, here is a country which has held presidential elections without foreign observers, without the United Nations, Sadc and most of these civil society organisations, but they were successful, peaceful elections conducted by Malawi on its own.  “This makes us think on whether it is still necessary in the future for Sadc nations to look for supervision from across oceans. It’s a question we are still interrogating,” he said.  Mnangagwa further said Chakwera’s visit was an opportunity to refocus cooperation between Zimbabwe and Malawi in trade, agriculture, mining, and social services while calling for increased economic relations.  “Private sector led business exchanges and cooperation as well as between our small and medium enterprises, must be enhanced. The ongoing consultations between our officials to establish a Zimbabwe-Malawi Business Forum to facilitate increased trade and cooperation should be speedily concluded.  “It is commendable that Malawian companies always exhibit at our Zimbabwe International Trade Fair. I challenge more Zimbabwean companies to equally participate at different expos hosted in Malawi, including the Takulandirani Tourism Indaba for mutual benefit,” he said. Sponsored Links
