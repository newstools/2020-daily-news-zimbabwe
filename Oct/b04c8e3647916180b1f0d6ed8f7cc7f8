Vasco Chaya LIFESTYLE WRITER chayav@dailynews.co.zw  VETERAN playwright and actor Ben Mahaka has helped aspiring actors from the Ndau community to realise their dreams in film industry through the popular television play Gaza. The play is aired on ZTV on Friday evenings. Mahaka, who hails from Chipinge, is happy with the way his inexperienced cast has managed to cope, making the ultimate product a must-watch. Popularly known as Tom Mbambo, thanks to the role he played in the soapie Studio 263, Mahaka said some of the actors in Gaza have potential to compete on international platforms. One of them is Angeline Majecha who plays the role of Sigauke’s wife or simply Mai Remy. Mahaka said actors need to be punctual for them to make it big in the industry. Mahaka said determination is a vital aspect in film industry. “There is also Faith Museta who shares camera duties on Gaza with my cousin Tashinga Mahaka). Faith’s ethos in life is ‘Never Say Die’. You can’t put her down and you can’t tell her that she can’t do something without proof.  Without any prior experience, she decided to try camera. We let her. She surprised us. She got the technical elements of the job immediately,” Mahaka said. Apart from being a videographer, Museta also plays the gossipy vendor who sells tomatoes at the same market as Mrs Muyambo. Mahaka also give the young actors an opportunity to write plays. “Iris Hlatywayo plays the very naughty Peggy Muyambo in the series, but more importantly, she is also the co-writer. She has a crazy sense of humour and  she is my guide in all things to do with Ndau cultural norms. Whenever we had a debate about what is authentic Ndau custom when a girl gets pregnant or when a woman leaves her matrimonial home, Iris had the answers.  “It was tough to get Iris into her writing role. I tried to get her to use Scrivener until I realised that she wasn’t comfortable with my MacBook Pro, so we bought counter books and pens. Her aha moment was when she watched the first scene she had written being brought to life by the actors. We had an avid writer,” he said.  Sponsored Links
