Sindiso Mhlophe SENIOR STAFF WRITER mhlophes@dailynhews.co.zw  The World Trade Organisation (WTO) has commended ongoing efforts by authorities to stabilise the country’s currency and economy, the Daily News reports. This comes as the Zimbabwe dollar has lately been holding steady against major global currencies, following the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe’s (RBZ) launch of the foreign currency action system in June — which has stabilised the prices of most basic goods in the country. Speaking during the recent online review of Zimbabwe’s trade policies and practices, WTO Trade Policy Review Body chairperson Harald Aspelund commended the government’s efforts to stabilise the local currency. Since the launch of the action system, the Zimbabwe dollar has moved from 63 to the US dollar to the current 81 — while prices of basic goods and services have been stabilising in shops after a bout of steep increases fuelled by the collapse of the local currency against the US dollar. RBZ governor John Mangudya recently said Zimbabweans could look forward to a more stable economy going forward. Meanwhile, Aspelund further said that member states had welcomed Zimbabwe’s commitment to undertaking economic reforms aimed at macro-economic stability and addressing structural issues. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); He added that Zimbabwe’s ratification of the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) was good, with member states encouraging the country to take appropriate measures to align its regimes to the relevant provisions of the agreement. “Several delegations commended Zimbabwe on its active participation in trade negotiations, including the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and the Tripartite Free Trade Area between COMESA, EAC and SADC, in addition to concluding an EPA with the European Union,” he said.
