  THE ongoing industrial action by teachers in public schools has paralysed the education sector and the government should stop all pretences that all is well.
It is staggering to stomach dissembling claims by Primary and Secondary Education minister Cain Mathema that the majority of teachers are atwork. The brutal truth is that there is no learning taking place in public schools. Teachers are notreporting for work! Mathema’s lackadaisical approach to the strike is laughable and shows lack of seriousness. Instead of finding ways to resolve the crisis that has serious consequences on the future of our school
children, he had gone into blame game mode. He claims Labour minister Paul Mavima should resolve the strike over remuneration and better working conditions for teachers. But who is in charge of the Education ministry? Is it not that Mathema and Mavima sit in the same Cabinet? Over a decade ago, we faced a similar situation. Teachers went on an indefinite strike and we witnessed the mushrooming of private schools. That phenomenon is set to happen again. The mushrooming of private schools and colleges was a matter of great concern. Slowly, but surely education in the country started being commoditised, becoming too expensive for the
ordinary people who are battling to eke a living under a harsh economic environment characterised by high unemployment. Our fears are that most private schools, besides being expensive, are illegal. Lawlessness and mediocrity should never be accepted in the education sector. Zimbabwe is known the world over for its quality education and should never compromise it. Those who seek to make money via poorly set up private colleges should be dealt with swiftly
and firmly. Treating the education sector as an industry has resulted in the cropping up of all sorts of private colleges, leading to compromised quality of learning. There is need for a refocus on privatisation of education. We have no doubt that there are more demerits than merits in allowing the privatisation of the education sector. Zimbabwean students can’t cope with the effects of privatised education, rather it has resulted
in numerous drop-outs because of exorbitant tuition fees. The government must urgently bring to an end the teachers’ strike and invest in public schools and colleges to minimise the vagaries of privatisation of the education sector Sponsored Links
