machakairet@dailynews.co.zwUNLESS brawling MDC leaders end their futile wars soon, Nelson Chamisa will not be able to participate in the party’s leadership contests when the court-directed extra-ordinary congress gets underway at the end of the year, the Daily News reports. The party’s interim leadership led by Thokozani Khupe, pictured, emphasised at a media briefing in Harare yesterday that all MDC Alliance leaders, as well as expelled members were not eligible to take part in the December elective assembly. This comes after Khupe expelled Chamisa in June this year — which effectively leaves him with no other choice but to form his own party if he still harbours political ambitions. Barring any other dramatic developments over the coming weeks, it also means that the bid by MDC youths to unite the party has fallen flat on its face. At the same time, the Supreme Court yesterday granted Khupe time to hold the party’s delayed extra-ordinary congress by year-end — in another development that also has far-reaching implications on the future of the country’s main opposition.Supreme Court judges Susan Mavangira, Chinembiri Bhunu and Alfias Chitakunye delivered yesterday’s ruling, in which they set new timelines for the congress, which was delayed at the height of Covid-19 in July. Khupe had sought an extension within which the MDC was supposed to have convened the extra-ordinary congress after the March Supreme Court judgment which nullified Chamisa’s ascendancy to the party’s leadership. Yesterday’s ruling, however, could worsen Chamisa’s increasingly tenuous association with the MDC — following his dismissal from the party in June. In a letter to Chamisa dated June 1, Khupe summarily dismissed the charismatic politician from the MDC for having allegedly violated the party’s constitutional provisions. His dismissal followed the March Supreme Court ruling which annulled Chamisa’s hotly-disputed ascendancy to the leadership of the MDC. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); That ruling meant that Chamisa had, on paper, reverted to being the secretary for policy and research in the party — the position he held before  the late party’s founding president, Morgan Tsvangirai, unilaterally elevated him and Elias Mudzuri to the MDC presidium. Chamisa and Khupe have been brawling for the control of the party since Tsvangirai’s death on Valentine’s Day in 2018.The battle has in the past three months worsened with each passing day, with Khupe recalling a total 31 party legislators to date and several councillors who had aligned themselves with Chamisa. Only this week, Khupe recalled 10 more MPs from Parliament, including Chamisa’s deputy Lynette Karenyi Kore — who had earned her seat for Manicaland via the proportional representation route. Others include Dorcas Sibanda (Bulawayo proportional representative), Caston Matewu (Marondera Central)), Concilia Chinanzvavana (Mashonaland West proportional representative), Susan Matsunga (Mufakose), Prince Dubeko Sibanda (Binga North), Unganai Tarusenga (St Mary’s), Eric Murai (Highfield East), Wellington Chikombo (Glen Norah) and Etheridge Kureva (Epworth). Prior to this week’s sackings, the Khupe group had also recalled 21 other legislators — including MDC Alliance secretary-general Chalton Hwende. The latest recalls cast further doubts on the push by MDC youths to end the party’s mindless brawling.This comes after party youths seized MRT House earlier this week in a desperate bid to force dialogue between Khupe and Chamisa. The two have been involved in a vicious tussle for the control of the country’s largest opposition party ever since the late and revered Tsvangirai succumbed to cancer of the colon on Valentine’s Day in 2018. The Daily News has reported on the MDC’s senseless brawls consistently, fairly and accurately over the past two years — calling out the futility of the anarchy, albeit to no avail. At the weekend, political analysts warned that the party’s futile infighting was driving the MDC to its death bed. They also repeated their other warnings that the divided opposition would find it exceedingly difficult to compete with Zanu PF in the fast-approaching 2023 national elections. Sponsored Links
