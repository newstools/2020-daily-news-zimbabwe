 THE Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation is reaching out to organisations and individuals who are interested in unlocking the inherent value and potential of Creative and Cultural Industries (CCIs) to become a formidable and robust economic sector for Zimbabwe. This came out early this week when Minister Kirsty Coventry on an online ZOOM platform pronounced that the National Cultural and Creative Industries Strategy for the period 2020 to 2030 was now in place. “I wish to officially pronounce online to our Cultural and Creative Industries Sector and its practitioners, our stakeholders, Captains of Industry and commerce, as well as our Civic society that the National Cultural and Creative Industries Strategy for the period 2020 to 2030 is now in place. “The Strategy is a roadmap that will guide the development and growth of the Cultural and Creative Industries sector, so that it becomes a critical player in the matrix of attaining an Upper Middle Income Society as spelt out in Vision 2030 as we address the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). “The Strategy identifies 10 pillars that need to be accorded immediate attention within the timelines given. Attending to these pillars will firmly position the CCIs as pivotal for the sector’s role in national economic development and employment creation.” Coventry said products from the CCIs sector which inherently contribute to building social cohesion, peace and the marketing of Zimbabwe will also gain a foothold. “The ten pillars are; Cultural markets and business development; intellectual property; funding, financing and investment; education, capacity building and training; cultural infrastructure; cultural statistics and research; media, information and communication technologies; cultural diplomacy and global business; cultural governance and; safeguarding cultural heritage.” The minister implored stakeholders to glean from this National Cultural and Creative Industries Strategy so that from it, they could also craft their own strategy. “It is also critical for me to underline that during the implementation of the Strategy, the Ministry will include a wide range of stakeholders from the public and private sectors. Most importantly, the various State and private-owned institutions, which include the media, Universities, Polytechnics, Teacher Education Colleges and those specialised institutions that not only offer technical training, but also nurture and expose creative talent, including the film and theatre schools, will be duly courted.” She added that as a Ministry they are inviting the corporate world, development partners, agencies and educational institutions to feel free to pick aspects among the 10 pillars that they wish to run with or partner the Ministry or CCIs sector players in their implementation support processes.
