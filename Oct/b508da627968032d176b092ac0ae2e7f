POSTAL and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (Potraz) director general Gift
Machengete, has said digital technologies are crucial for the success of the post coronavirus (Covid-19) economic recovery agenda as they offer access to new and previously inaccessible global markets, the Daily News reports.
This comes as the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted global trade through restrictions in regional and international travel, prompting governments, businesses, educators among others to embrace the new normal and adopt the use of digital technologies. Speaking during yesterday’s Global Symposium for Regulators Ministerial roundtable held virtually, Machengete said digital technologies were being used for information dissemination, forecasting and contact tracing in a bid to stop the spread of Covid-19, adding that their continued use after the virus would be critical. “The pandemic has seen increased use of digital technologies and as such, increased demand for broadband. The prevailing high use of digital technologies will certainly continue in the future as they bring convenience to people’s lives and ease of doing business. In the future, digital platforms will also be used to predict and combat similar
outbreaks. To note, governments have relied on online platforms to disseminate information, create awareness and debunk fake news. These online platforms will continue to be used to disseminate information even after Covid-19. “Governments have also relied on digital applications that provide artificial intelligence to forecast the spread of the virus and impact of the pandemic, allowing for planning and implementation of appropriate mitigation measures for Covid-19 as well as predict future occurrence of pandemics of similar nature,” Machengete said. He added that virtual business meetings would continue after the pandemic as they cut costs associated with physical meetings. “This trend of working from home is likely to be the new normal even after the pandemic as companies can save on rentals and utilities. While physical trade was stopped during the lock downs, businesses continued trading online, making use
of various e-commerce platforms available such as e-bay and Amazon. This trend will certainly continue after Covid-19,” he said. Sponsored Links
