Mugove Tafirenyika SENIOR STAFF WRITER tafirenyikam@dailynews.co.zw  MDC bigwigs say they are frustrated by the painfully slow progress towards the much talked about national dialogue — amid claims that authorities are blocking South African officials from returning to the country to assist Zimbabwe end its challenges. Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, MDC Alliance vice president Welshman Ncube, pictured, confirmed that they were not happy with the current snail’s pace towards the resolution of the country’s decades-long political and economic challenges. At the same time, he warned that any failure to resolve the country’s myriad crises would lead to a further complication of the problems, as well as political unrest — as anger was building up among long-suffering Zimbabweans. This comes as South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa and his ruling African National Congress (ANC) have been trying to assist Zimbabwe in ending its long-standing problems — which recently attracted international attention after authorities were accused of human rights abuses. It also comes after President Emmerson Mnangagwa recently said that he was prepared to engage the opposition, but only within the confines of the Political Actors Dialogue (Polad) — a platform which brings together candidates of the 2018 presidential elections. Speaking in the exclusive interview with the Daily News yesterday, Ncube said they were not happy with the current slow pace of developments on the talks front. “Zanu PF is behaving like a drug addict in denial. Until a drug addict accepts that he has a problem no one can help him. “At that point, the young people will tell us to go and hang, and take matters into their own hands and use other means that are not necessarily peaceful. “What happened to Ian Smith when he refused to listen to the people’s demands? The youths of that time decided to use other means. That time will certainly come,” Ncube warned. Ramaphosa dispatched ANC bigwigs to Zimbabwe last month to engage Zanu PF, as part of efforts to assist the country. The two former liberation movements were said to have been very candid and robust with each other in their heart-to-heart dialogue, which was held at the Zanu PF headquarters in Harare. Following the visit by the ANC bigwigs, the South African ruling party said it welcomed Zanu PF’s decision to let them meet the country’s opposition and other interest groups in future. Yesterday, Ncube also told the Daily News that they were still hopeful that South Africa, Sadc and the African Union (AU) would help Zimbabwe to end its myriad crises. “Our position remains that the only peaceful and sustainable solution to the decades-long crises in Zimbabwe is dialogue among Zimbabweans, to find a political settlement that will open the doors for economic revival. “However, and because of the levels of mistrust caused by Zanu PF’s insincerity, it is difficult for any dialogue to take place without external mediation. “We remain hopeful and we will continue to lobby South Africa, Sadc and the AU to realise that they have a responsibility to help Zimbabwe. But deputy Foreign Affairs minister, David Musabayana, refuted Ncube’s claims that authorities were refusing to grant ANC bigwigs clearance to return for meetings with the opposition and other interest groups. “I really do not see how they can be blocked, unless it was the South African government that wanted to come. “I am not aware of any request from anyone to come and meet them that was blocked. The president has always talked about engagement and re-engagement,” he said. Last month, Mnangagwa said he would not seek outside intervention to hold dialogue with the opposition and other key stakeholders in the country. However, and despite ruling out outside intervention, Mnangagwa also said the country’s deepening challenges required unity of purpose among all Zimbabweans. Speaking at last month’s Polad meeting, he said the door remained open for Nelson Chamisa and others who had snubbed the platform to join him there and work together to deal with Zimbabwe’s problems.
