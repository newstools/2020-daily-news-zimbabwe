Sindiso Mhlophe SENIOR STAFF WRITER mhlophes@dailynews.co.zw PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa yesterday conferred degrees to 447 students at the Harare Institute of Technology (HIT), with the institution revealing that it is set to launch a mobile phone manufacturing and television set assembly plant by year-end, the Daily News reports. Of the graduands, 91 were from the School of Information Science and Technology, 106 from the school of Business and Management Sciences, 151 from the School of Engineering and Technology, while 99 were from the School of Industrial Sciences and Technology with 20 coming out with first class degrees. Speaking during the graduation ceremony, HIT vice chancellor Quinton Kanhukamwe said in addition to the mobile phone and television plant currently at 50 percent completion, the institution had developed prototype ventilators, a coronavirus alert tracking system that keeps track of all recorded positive cases and a cloud seeding system, among other things. “Our new mindset, which we have been cultivating under strategic plan vision 2020: designing the future as well as guided by your reconfiguration of our education, through education 5.0 and vision 2030 has brought tangible output. Innovation leadership, integrity and professionalism are the fundamental values that drive our actions. “Our technovation centre to date has driven, among other projects, the tap card payment system which is currently at 34 percent implementation across the country. To date through tap cards, over $2,4 billion has passed through the system, demonstrating that we can contribute and bring about a cashless transport system. It is also creating downstream employment through agencies that are being deployed across towns and cities throughout the country. “The fuel management project measurements have been collected from all provinces, sensors have been procured and shipment is expected to arrive in the next week. Software development is at an advanced stage of completion. The centre has also spearheaded the national fuel smartcard. The project has been completed and is currently being piloted by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ). “It is our hope that this project will contribute to the elimination of the chaos in the fuel value chain system and bring discipline in our national transportation system as every drop of fuel will be accounted for,” Kanhukamwe said. He added that the centre had also developed the bureau de change system project which was currently being managed through the RBZ, saying that the system would enable the RBZ to manage and monitor all transactions in real time. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); “A total of 32 more local authorities are set to roll out the software that uses artificial intelligence in managing the affairs of their activities’ as well as in our town councils. Transformers for farmers, some district councils, various corporate bodies and also the Econet project which required transformers for Cyclone Idai victims were completed and done.  Our project team is now pursuing prospects to link with the Rural Electrification Agency so that we can assist them in repairing a lot of their transformers which are currently down,” he said.
