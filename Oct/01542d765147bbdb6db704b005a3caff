 THE Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc) has broadened its investigative scope to cover money laundering, misappropriation of funds and extortion by public officials, the Daily News reports.
This comes as the under pressure anti-graft commission is seeking to nail more big  wigs after compiling 80 dockets which it says will be handed over to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) for trial before year-end. Officially opening the second corruption investigations training for 23 officers in Harare yesterday, Zacc chairperson Loice Matanda-Moyo said the commission now had the expertise to investigate more serious and
complex graft cases. “Zacc has embarked on a drive to recruit competent officers as part of its efforts to strengthen the investigation wing and other departments. “Since I joined the anti-corruption commission, all the offences we hear … are about abuse of office. “However, there are other offences which Zacc must investigate with the coming in of new investigating officers. “I am sure that now we are going to see more people being arrested for money laundering … misappropriation of funds … extortion, conflict of interest and other cases that Zacc was not concentrating on,” MatandaMoyo also said. She said the commission had successfully investigated and prosecuted several cases involving former Cabinet ministers and senior government officials, some of whom were currently serving jail terms, while others
were before the courts. This comes as former Energy minister Samuel Undenge is serving a two-and-a-half-year jail term for corruptly ordering Zesa Holdings to award a US$12 000 tender to a public relations company. Matanda-Moyo said besides pursuing criminal matters, Zaac was also targeting asset recovery. She said the country had lost billions of United States dollars to corruption and that most of the money was spirited abroad where it was used to acquire assets. “When you investigate you are not only investigating for the sake of prosecution, but also for asset recovery. “I want to make sure that at the end of my tour of duty we would have recovered billions of dollars which have been stolen from Zimbabwe. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); “That money is required to be injected back into the economy so that our citizens benefit, and not that the corrupt benefit,” she said further.
