Dakarai Mashava STAFF WRITERmashavad@dailynews.co.zwMIMOSA Mining Company is determined to improve the human conditions and quality of life of people living in communities they operate in, the company’s managing director Fungai Makoni has said.Makoni’s remarks follow the recent commissioning, by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, of a 20-bed state-of-the-art private ward at Zvishavane District Hospital and a girls’ hostel at Zvishavane Vocational Training Centre constructed by the mining company.Makoni said the two projects, which cost over US$1,1 million, reflected Mimosa’s history of fruitful partnerships with strategic stakeholders and communities.“Our focus is on transforming lives and growing local economies with lasting legacies.“We are motivated by a desire to cultivate and grow mutually beneficial relationships that will endure long into the future in our corporate social investment programmes, with respect and care for our people being an integral component to our business,” he said.At Zvishavane Vocational Training Centre, where Mimosa put in place key infrastructure and helped in the development of the training curriculum, Makoni said the platinum mining company was motivated by the desire to equip young people, particularly the girl child, with vocational skills so that they can generate income as small to medium scale business owners.“We believe that by promoting skills training and enterprise development in youths we can make positive and profound interventions that change their life trajectory for the better.“We are thus motivated by a desire to secure social and economic mobility for young people who could struggle to find their feet in life without focused training and skills.“Mimosa’s partnership with Zvishavane Vocational Training Centre was motivated by a desire to impact positively on young people, especially the girl child, by harnessing her potential for self-actualisation through acquisition of useful professional skills,” he said.Mimosa has done various projects at Zvishavane Vocational Training Centre since 2014 which include renovation and resourcing of the buildings, the setting up of a computer laboratory as well as the recently commissioned girls’ hostel.The institution currently has an enrolment of 146 students across six disciplines.“The girls’ hostel was necessitated by the increased requests from communities that girls were being side-lined in obtaining life-giving skills at the institution as they fail to secure accommodation in the town.“This then prompted Mimosa Mine to consider building a residential hostel that will accommodate girls from around Zvishavane as they enrol at the institution,” said Makoni.The construction of a 20-bed state-of-the-art private ward at Zvishavane District Hospital, according to Makoni, is in line with the fact that health interventions are key areas of their corporate social responsibility investments.“The health service sector is vital in any economy.“It is an important indicator on the world human development index against which a country’s state of wellbeing is judged.“In the past Mimosa has partnered with several health institutions. Some of the beneficiaries of Mimosa’s initiatives are Chitungwiza General Hospital, Mpilo Central Hospital, Harare Central Hospital, Masvingo Provincial Hospital, and St Giles Medical Rehabilitation Centre in Harare,” said Makoni.
