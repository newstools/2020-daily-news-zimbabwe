 MAI Titi’s new boyfriend Charles Obina has splashed R50 000 on the social media sensation to undergo a beauty
therapy in South Africa.
Obina is a Nigerian national who is believed to be a man of means. “I had my liposuction and face peeling for the very first time and it took me about R50 000 for the whole process but trust me, I love the new me and I want to thank my boyfriend Obina for sacrificing for me to achieve what I wanted. Above all the famous doctor from Herrwood Medical Centre,” Mai Titi, real name Felistas Murata, said. Mai Titi,34, said she is still to come to terms with what happened in her life. “I used to see him (the doctor) on television doing other celebrities like Zodwa, DJ Tira but I finally got to meet him in person thanks to my boyfriend who made it happen.” Mai Titi who is also a recorded musician, said the exercise was worth it. “It might be expensive but it’s worth it. Ladies if you having issues dzemapundu nemafats muchingosekwa kunzi hee jojo tank hee akashata (with protruding bellies and being mocked . . . a jojo water tank while others
saying you are ugly) just run to Herrwood Medical Centre and you will thank me later,” she said. Meanwhile, Obina came into Mai Titi’s life barely some months after she broke up with ex-boyfriend Zizoe Pamyke who is 26. Mai Titi who ventured into the music industry at the age of 18 and has two daughters — Felisha and Tanatswa who is simply known as Titi — broke up with Zizoe in the United Kingdom after dating for some months.
However, she told the Daily News she has ‘‘forgiven Zizoe and moved on with her life.’’ “Everyone deserves to be loved and I thank God for making me happy again,” she said. Sponsored Links
