  TWO senior police officers have been arrested on allegations of interfering with the probe on suspended Criminal Investigations Department director, commissioner Crispen Charumbira, who was recently arrested on corruption related charges.
Stephen Kuwaza, 42, the officer in charge of CID Theft from Car department and superintendent Alwis Shingirayi Chidziva, who is the superintendent administration at Mutare Minerals Unit, were not asked to plead to
allegations of defeating or obstructing the course of justice when they appeared before regional magistrate Bianca Makwande. They were both remanded in custody to Monday for bail application but the State has indicated its opposition to them being granted bail. Kuwaza is accused of threatening to cause the transfer of his junior, one Bryan
Moyo — a key witness in the corruptionrelated charges against Charumbira. According to the State, on October 7, Moyo received a call from his lawyer that Kuwaza was pursuing a High Court order that had barred the police from transferring him until his matter was finalised. State counsel George Manokore told the court that Moyo reportedly phoned Kuwaza inquiring why he
was pursuing the matter. Kuwaza then allegedly indicated that he had orders from his superiors to establish
if Moyo had implicated commissioner Charumbira in his High Court application. The court heard that Moyo quizzed Kuwaza on who had given him the orders but he was evasive. The officer in
charge of CID Theft from Car department then allegedly threatened Moyo. “Zvinyaya zvenyu zvekusungisa mashefu echipurisa muchizviita makachenjera manje toda kuona kuti
uchashandirepi. I’m the officer in charge here newewo uchatorisiya basa iri uchirikurida nehondo dzawatanga idzi,” Kuwaza is alleged to have said. The State alleges that Kuwaza’s conduct amounts to undue interference with a witness with the aim of
obstructing justice.
Chidziva, on the other hand, is accused of intimidating a junior officer by reprimanding him for giving evidence
in the investigations against Charumbira. The court heard that on September 25, the junior officer, Tamirirashe Mashenjere, was ordered to bring the
station exhibit book to Police General Headquarters. The book was required as part of investigation into the matter in which Charumbira was being investigated
for allegedly instructing police officers who had arrested one David Mucheche for illegal possession of two kilogrammes of gold, to give it back to him and release him. On September 26 after his return from Harare, Mashenjere briefed Chidziva on what had transpired. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); Chidziva allegedly accused Mashenjere of failing to keep secrets of the Mutare Minerals Unit, allegedly implying that he was not supposed to tell the truth to the investigation officers. The State alleges that the conduct was tantamount to obstructing the course of justice in the investigation as it was meant to  intimidate Mashenjere from volunteering information to the investigating officers. On October 14, Mashenjere was summoned to the Special Anti-corruption Unit to be quizzed on the allegations. Sponsored Links
