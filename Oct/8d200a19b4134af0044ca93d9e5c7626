THE Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (Zera) has announced new fuel prices which have seen diesel slightly going down by five percent, while petrol slightly increased by four percent, the Daily News reports.
In a public notice, the regulator said petrol had increased to $97,62 from $93,15 while diesel had decreased to $81,85 from $86,36. For United States dollar prices, the price of petrol increased to US$1,20 from US$1,18 while diesel decreased to US$1 from US$1,09. “Operators may, however, sell at prices below the cap, depending on their trading advantages,” Zera said. Zera’s acting chief executive officer Edington Mazambani said the prices of fuel were affected by changes in the local exchange rate, the increase of duty under Statutory Instrument (SI) 192 of 2020 and the increase in global fuel prices.
