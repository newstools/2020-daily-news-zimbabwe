 Austin Karonga SPORTS WRITER karongaa@dailynews.co.zw FORMER Zimbabwe Test captain Graeme Cremer has been appointed the director of Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Rajasthan Royals Academy in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In a bid to continue with their commitment to discovering talent, harnessing potential, and championing dreams, Rajasthan Royals will officially launch the academy this coming Monday. This will be the franchise’s first academy in the Middle East and its second global cricket academy as  Rajasthan Royals become the first IPL team to establish operations in the UAE. The academy is another step taken by the franchise in establishing its global presence as a cricketing brand and promoting the sport around the world. Cremer relocated to the UAE in January 2019 after deciding to end his international career with Zimbabwe to be close to his wife Merna, who is a pilot with Emirates Airlines. The 34-year-old leg-spinner has 211 international wickets to his name after representing Zimbabwe in 19 Tests and 96 ODIs during a 14-year spell. Cremer and his academy protégées will be based at the The Sevens Stadium facility which is also the home of Emirates Airline’s Rugby 7s side. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); The venue boasts three world-class ovals, two of which are floodlit, six floodlit turf nets and fully equipped changing rooms of the highest standards, suitable for participants of all ages. Rajasthan Royals chief operating officer Jake Lush McCrum said they hope to unearth new talent from the huge pool in the UAE. Sponsored Links
