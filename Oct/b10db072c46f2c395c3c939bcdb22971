Sindiso Mhlophe  THE United Kingdom (UK) and United States of America (US) have once again accentuated the need for Zimbabwe to implement sound political and economic reforms in order to address the country’s crises and unlock the much-needed international support and investment, the Daily News on Sunday reports. This comes as the government has insisted it is implementing sound political and economic reforms in a bid to re-engage with the international community. Speaking during a meeting of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Trade Policy Review Body meeting, attended by deputy Foreign Affairs minister David Musabayana recently, the UK’s ambassador to the WTO and United Nations, Julian Braithwaite said while the government’s efforts to reform were welcome, there was still a need for the government to implement fundamental reforms in order for the country to unlock international trade among other things. “We welcome the government of Zimbabwe’s commitment to economic and political reforms and hope to see more trade and investment with Zimbabwe in the future. We believe there is notable potential in the renewable energy, agriculture and financial services sectors; sectors with the potential to improve livelihoods and financial inclusion. Braithwaite added that meaningful progress on reforms, along with respect for human rights and the rule of law, were the only ways to sustainably deal with Zimbabwe’s underlying challenges, unlock significant investment and bring about a better future for the country and its people. “Within the mining sector, signing up to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, restarting efforts to digitise mining licences and ensuring compliance with environmental impact assessment requirements, would go some way to restoring the confidence of international investors,” Braithwaite said. He commended the government’s effort in resolving outstanding land issues through the compensation of white former commercial farmers and those who were protected under the Bilateral Investment Protection and Promotion Agreements (BIPPAs) and Bilateral Investment Treaties googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); Braithwaite urged the government to remove barriers to the importation of renewable energy equipment, and to continue with efforts to improve the enabling environment in the distributed power sector. Speaking at the same event, the US ambassador to the WTO Dennis Shea said numerous obstacles undermine Zimbabwe’s efforts to increase trade and harness its benefits, thereby impeding the country’s sustainable development.
