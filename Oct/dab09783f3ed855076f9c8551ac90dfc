Jeffrey Muvundusi in BULAWAYO THE Information, Technology, Postal and Courier Services ministry is crafting a 2030 master plan which seeks to explore ICT’s capability as a pillar of development in the country. ICT minister Jenfan Muswere yesterday said the master plan to be rolled out soon was the way to go in this digital era. “The master plan, once fully rolled out, will completely transform government processes, services and management, and make information access and service delivery more efficient,”  Muswere said during the official opening of a Community Information Centre (CIC) at Bulu Secondary School in Plumtree, Matabeleland South Province. The ICT policy of 2016-20 articulates the aim of providing connectivity in all schools in order to bridge the urban-rural digital divide, and to enhance teaching and learning through the use of technology. “Again, the master plan, with the flagship projects to pilot its implementation will steer the march towards the digital future that will transform the country to a regional technical hub, raise the country’s competitiveness and align the country in line with vision 2030’s ICT goals,” Muswere said. Meanwhile, the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (Potraz) director-general Gift Machengete said the Bulu Secondary School CIC is modelled around the Connect a School — Connect a Community concept. The telecommunications regulatory authority is setting up CICs through the Universal Services Fund (USF) to ensure that ICTs are extended to marginalised members of the communities in Zimbabwe to bridge the digital divide. “Such projects aimed at advancing ICT access and use in rural and marginalised areas are key for national development… Initiatives such as the Bulu High School Computer Laboratory project are strategic in ensuring the digital divide is bridged and everyone is at par in the digital economy,” he said.
