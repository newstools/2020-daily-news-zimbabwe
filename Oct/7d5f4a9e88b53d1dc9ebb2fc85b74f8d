 THE government has published a school calendar which will see the last term of this year ending seven days before the Christmas holiday.  This comes as schools reopened for examination candidates from mid this month with other grades set to resume classes in the next few weeks in two phases.  According to the government, the last term of the 2020 school calendar ends on December 18 and students are going to have a holiday of up to January 4, 2021.  Students who have already opened school will spend 60 days, phase two 40 days and phase three 30 days in class. However, teachers’ unions yesterday blasted Primary and Secondary Education minister Cain Mathema for failing to solve problems affecting the education sector.  Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (Artuz) president Obert Masaraure said Mathema is out of touch with reality.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); “Mathema should know that 98 percent of Zimbabwe’s 136 000 teachers are on strike. These teachers cannot be replaced by his 10 000 reserve teachers. Mathema also got the 10 000 unemployed teachers’ statistics wrong. Zimbabwe has 37 000 who are out of employment.  “The Unemployed Teachers Association (UTA) maintains the database. UTA has, however, declared that they are not willing to be used as a reserve labour force by the government, they are demanding to be employed to fill the staff shortage of over 90 000 teachers.”  In a statement, Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe president Takavafira Zhou said Mathema had misled the government over the situations in schools.  “Hope you will also accurately convey to the Cabinet and President of Zimbabwe that the situation in schools is not palatable and coronavirus (Covid-19) abatement equipment is not available in more than 70 percent of schools in rural areas,”  Efforts to get comment from Mathema were fruitless as his phone went unanswered.
