 Austin Karonga THE Zimbabwe Rugby Union (ZRU) is now waiting on their medical committee to come up with health protocols at match venues before the sport can return during this coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. This comes as the ZRU was granted permission to resume training by the Sports and Recreation Commission on Wednesday afternoon. Since March, the government banned all sporting events as a precautionary measure against the spread of the novel virus. However, in recent weeks a number of sporting disciplines have been allowed to resume their activities while observing strict social distancing protocols. “The moment we received the communication from the SRC we sent it to our medical committee who will provide us with the Covid-19 prevention protocols throughout our stadia. “We also have engaged our key stakeholders so as to map the way forward. We had leagues that still had not been completed. “We had the U21 finals still to be played in Harare and in Bulawayo and a sponsored National U21 final between Harare and Bulawayo that was still to be played; the key stakeholders will make the decision,” ZRU spokesperson Simba Danga told the Daily News yesterday. With a lot of emphasis being given to social distancing, Danga is confident Sevens rugby will be the top priority moving forward. “Ordinarily by October, we would have been done with the senior 15s games and we would now be in full swing with the Sevens. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); “We are seized with the preparations for the Sevens as they somewhat present us with more social distancing as a few players are on the field compared to the 15s game. “The Sevens’ game will allow us to play the game safely with very few people involved close up on the field,” Danga added.
