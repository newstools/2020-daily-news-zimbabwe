 CRIMINAL Investigation Department boss Crispen Charumbira was yesterday slapped with fresh criminal abuse of office charges relating to an incident that he ordered constables to release a suspect that had been held
for illegal gold dealing.
Charumbira appeared before Harare provincial magistrate Vongai Muchuchuti-Guwuriro and was released on $10 000 bail with conditions to continue residing at his current address, not to interfere with witnesses and report every Friday at Police General Headquarters. The matter was remanded to November 11. Charumbira recently appeared in court facing three counts of similar
charges after interfering with investigations and ordering the release of suspects from lawful custody. In the current matter, Prosecutor Charles Muchemwa alleged that sometime in June last year, detectives identified as Mashange, Chada and Mahere arrested David Mucheche in Murambi, Mutare for contravening the Gold Trade Act by dealing in gold without a licence. The court heard Crosby handed the phone over to Machaka and advised him that Charumbira was on the line and wanted to speak to him. It was alleged that Charumbira instructed Machaka to release Mucheche without confirmation of existence of a licence, recording the exhibit in any official record book and without pressing any charges on him. Charumbira also ordered Machaka to return the recovered gold to Mucheche. The court heard Machaka tried to inform Charumbira that he wanted to verify whether Mucheche was in possession of a permit or licence to deal in gold before authorising his release but was ordered to set him free forthwith. Machaka complied with the instruction and released Mucheche without having it entered into official books at the station. In one of the pending charges it was alleged that on December 17 detectives identified as Ndlovu, Mbundire and detective Munyandure of CID Drugs, Harare received information that Charles Chabata Magolise
was in possession of dangerous drugs at his place of residence. The team reacted to the information and arrested him before a search was conducted leading to the recovery of 443g of dagga. When he heard that Magolise had been arrested, Charumbira called Ndlovu instructing him to release him
but the team did not take heed of his instructions and took him to Harare Central for docket compilation after consultation with the Officer Commanding CID Drugs, Harare. The court heard when Charumbira arrived at Harare Central he summoned the arresting team to his office and pleaded with them to release the accused person. After realising that the team was not yielding to his demands, Charumbira became emotional and ordered
them out of his office. Magolise was taken to court and convicted before being sentenced to eight months in prison. Sponsored Links
