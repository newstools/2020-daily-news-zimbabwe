 MUSICIANS have united against child abuse and ritual murders in a new song titled Tinyareiwo. The project is the brainchild of seasoned producer Lyton Ngolomi, the founder and director of Lyton Studios. “The idea was inspired by the recent tragic incident in Murewa where a seven-year-old boy, Tapiwa Makore, was murdered, purportedly for ritual purposes. Through music, we are trying to spread awareness in society,” Ngolomi said. On the song, Ngolomi worked with musicians Lazzie T, Aaron Juru (based in South Africa), Freedom Sharimo, Dispatch (Domocratic Republic of Congo), Pastor Matende, Audrey Chirimuuta (based in South Africa), Phammy Macheka (based in the United Kingdom), Tau Ngara (UK) and Feliz Da Vida from Mozambique, among others. “We are not confined to ritual murders alone but we are against child abuse in general. “The group is also going to release more songs in future focusing on different issues that affect society, including domestic violence and health issues,” he said. The song comes barely a week after artists from different genres staged a demonstration in the capital against ritual murders. Born in 1981, Ngolomi founded Lyton Studios in 2010 with his brother Brian. The studio was meant to record and promote upcoming gospel musicians and the stable played a pivotal role in the rise of big names in the industry like Blessing Shumba, Mathias Mhere, Kudzi Nyakudya, Agatha Murudzwa, Sebastian Magacha, Rumbi Zvirikuzhe and Olinda Marowa among others.
