Blessing Masakadza STAFF WRITER masakadzab@dailynews.co.zw WITH the country easing lockdown regulations, the entertainment sector is also opening up with entertainment and hangout joints, night clubs and pubs reopening and hosting events. Most of the popular night clubs have resumed full operations and are even advertising their events on social media. While over the past six months artistic performances were being hosted online in line with Covid-19 lockdown guidelines, the past week has seen venues hosting various showbiz events that include musicals. At most bottle stores and clubs, music is blasting throughout the night with patrons packed in the venues. The new development comes despite health authorities still maintaining a ban on public gatherings. Statutory Instrument 216 of 2020 which among other things allows the resumption of aviation activities and regulates tourism operations under the lockdown, also gave special provisions for those with liquor licences. Consumption of alcohol is now being allowed in restaurants and drinkers are allowed to sit. However, nothing has been announced by government in as far as entertainment events is concerned.  The situation on the ground, however, shows that a number of hangout places are back in full swing. “Licensees that may sell liquor to customers for consumption off the premises during licensed hours include wholesalers, wine producers and bottle stores. Licensees who may sell liquor to customers for consumption on the premises during licensed hours include restaurants, airports, recreational park areas, houseboats, camps and caravan parks. Licensees that may sell liquor to customers for consumption on premises during licensed hours include casinos and theatres,” government recommended. Reports are that a popular club in the Central Business District held a musical event in the capital although the proprietors were evasive over the matter. Motorists had a torrid time as revellers at the concert parked everywhere, making it impossible to use the nearby street. Crooner Munya Mataruse was on Friday in Chinhoyi for a performance at CUT Hotel and on Saturday at Bar Rouge in the capital and the promotional material was marked “limited tickets due to Covid-19 regulations”. On Saturday, Mbeu was in Chinhoyi for a performance at Chinhoyi Caves in partnership with the Zimbabwe National Parks. Bar Rouge in the heart of Long Cheng Plaza will this week host Baba Harare’s album launch and in strict adherence to Covid-19 regulations, they have said only 50 people will be allowed. Popular hangout joints such as the Volt Sundays are back at Hellenic Sports Club and they have all promised to observe strict health guidelines. Joints such as Mereki and KwaFarai are also operating at full capacity, with revellers enjoying their braai and refreshments. A number of clubs in the high density suburbs are now operating way into midnight but observance of Covid-19 regulations is virtually non-existent. Sponsored Links
