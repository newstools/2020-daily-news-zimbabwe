 THE Sadc region has once again called for the immediate lifting of Western sanctions on Zimbabwe on account of their adverse effects on ordinary citizens, the Daily News reports.
This comes as the United States of America, the United kingdom and the European Union maintain that President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s administration has not done enough to have the sanctions lifted. It also comes as Sadc nations commemorate the Anti-Sanctions Day today. Ahead of the commemorations, the chairperson of the Sadc Council of Ministers, Nataniel Macamo Dhlovo — who is also Mozambique’s Foreign Affairs minister — argued yesterday that Harare had done almost everything to show its sincerity in addressing the country’s political and economic challenges. “For almost two decades, unilateral economic sanctions have stunted the country’s economic growth and limited the overall prosperity of the Zimbabwean people. “Zimbabwe, like many other African nations, continues to bear the brunt of multiple global challenges. The detrimental effects of climate change including Cyclone Idai and three successive years of devastating drought
have impacted negatively upon its food security and a number of key sectors” Dlhovo said. “This already serious situation has been compounded by the social and economic consequences brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. “The severe economic downturn resulting from the pandemic has seriously limited the government’s ability to effectively fund public services, maintain welfare programmes and invest in struggling industries. “Zimbabweans need to be given space to effectively respond to the many challenges it faces. Under the leadership of president … Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe is currently undertaking extensive and courageous political and economic reforms,” Dlhovo added. “Important laws such as the Public Order and Security Act (Posa), the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act and the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act have been repealed,” Dhlovo
also said. “The administration’s efforts to enhance governance, operational transparency and the ease of doing business have resulted in the improvement of its rankings on various global indexes. Many other reforms are currently work in progress. “The recent US$3,5 billion compensation agreement with
representatives of some 3 000 farmers whose land was acquired under the fast track land reform programme of the early 2000s is also a clear demonstration of the administration’s commitment to the reform agenda to address legacy issues in a fair and transparent manner and honouring her pledge to place the county on a different and
positive trajectory,” he added. On his part, Mnangagwa paid tribute to Zimbabweans and the region for calling for the unconditional removal of the economic embargoes. However, the West remains adamant that Zimbabwe has not done enough to have sanctions imposed on the country in 2001 lifted. Sponsored Links
