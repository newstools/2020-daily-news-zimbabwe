  THE Zimbabwe Golf Association (ZGA) is hoping to stage at least one competition before the end of the year after they were recently granted approval by the government to resume their activities amid the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.  Following the recommendations made to the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC), ZGA got the all- clear with caddies returning and clubs restaurants allowed to reopen.  ZGA spokesperson Tirivashe Nheweyembwa said it has been an indifferent period during the lockdown. “We are quite excited that we have been given the green light to start the activities. However, let me say it’s going to take a bit of time for things to get back to where they were before.  “I think in terms of activities, we are expecting some clubs to host some tournaments before the end of the year. “I’m sure this will ensure we end the year in style.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); “Above and beyond this, we will continue to monitor the implementation of all the activities just to make sure that everyone is adhering to the rules and the safety of everyone is our primary concern,” Nheweyembwa told the Daily News yesterday.  Following the announcement by the SRC that golf is now allowed to resume, the ZGA has been overwhelmed by enquiries.  “We have started receiving requests from various organisations to host a golf tournament for fundraising purposes.” Sponsored Links
