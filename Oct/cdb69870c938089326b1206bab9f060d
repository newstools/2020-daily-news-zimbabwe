 THE news last week was dominated by the imposition of Tier 3 lockdown across swathes of the country
as efforts to slow the spread of coronavirus turn an evergrowing area of the United Kingdom into an economic
wasteland.
Coronavirus (Covid-19) is successfully strangling the life out of UK businesses just as the debt spiral shows no sign
of stopping. Yet the UK is not alone in this debacle. Most of Europe is in turmoil, as is the United States. All around the world, economies are in free fall – with one notable exception: China. Last week, little noticed by many, it was announced that China’s economic growth rate for the third quarter of 2020
was just short of five percent. In 2021, its economy is expected to grow by 7,6 percent. There is a deep sense of irony here. The country from which coronavirus came, and which did so little in the early
days to help the rest of the world escape its spread, is now bouncing back by selling us the equipment we need to
combat that very virus. Rising global demand for medical equipment, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and workfrom-home personal computers and phones have been boosting exports, giving China an astonishing trade surplus of US$58,93 billion. Even worse, investors in the West are queuing up to give China their money. US investors just invested US$27 billion in China’s first US direct investment bond. Foreign Direct Investment
inflows were up 2,5 percent year-on-year, amounting now to US$103 billion. Project Kow Tow is alive
and well, but it isn’t a uniquely British mistake – many others have followed the same path. The Chinese government has understood how short-term democracies can be in their outlook and has been following a strategic plan to take advantage, funded by the huge levels of western investment
into the country. That is why they set up the Belt and Road project. Sixty-eight countries, representing 65 percent of the
world’s population and 40 percent of global GDP, have now signed up to an arrangement that leaves the poorer nations involved so utterly dependent on China that none dare challenge it’s appalling behaviour. Worse, this economic colonisation ensures that any complaint brought to the UN is vetoed. Nor is it only developing
countries that suffer, as the example of Australia shows. Australia has, quite rightly, called for an independent inquiry into the cause of the pandemic. China furiously publicly denounced them and imposed sanctions, a step no doubt intended to intimidate any
others who might make similar criticisms. Lo and behold it has worked, leaving Australia alone in the firing line.
China has attempted to exert similar pressure on Britain, too, ordering the government to “immediately correct its
mistakes” after Britain reaffirmed its commitment to offer an accelerated route to citizenship for holders of British
National Overseas passports in Hong Kong. The fault here lies with the free world. For too long, in the pursuit of quick profits, government after government
has turned a blind eye to the growing abuses and aggression of China’s communist government. Business leaders, too, raced each other to invest. Now so many of them act as China’s useful idiots, defending its dictatorial government whenever required. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); China regularly breaks the WTO rules on trade, carries out industrial espionage and targets strategic market
areas while they then dominate through the use of illegal subsidy. On their borders, their aggression is growing. Examples include recent clashes with India in which Indian troops were killed. Then there are their astonishing claims of suzerainty over the resourcerich south China seas. Then there was the imposition of security laws in Hong Kong that trashed the Sino/British Hong
Kong agreement and was followed by the arrest of prodemocracy protesters. That is without considering their open
military threats to Taiwan. On top of all that sits their treatment of the Uighurs, a form of persecution widely agreed to amounts to genocide,
and includes the forced sterilisation of Uighur women and the use of re-education camps redolent of the concentration camps of the 1940s. In Tibet, labour camps have been springing up. In Inner Mongolia, the use of the Mongolian language has
been banned. Across China, Christians and practitioners of Falun Gong are persecuted for their faith which includes, it is believed, the illegal harvesting of their organs. All of this is going on while the Chinese
Communist Party dismisses or ignores the complaints of the rest of the world, knowing that
the West’s money just keeps flowing in.
