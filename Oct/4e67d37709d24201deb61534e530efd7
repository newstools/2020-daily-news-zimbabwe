 Jeffrey Muvundusi in BULAWAYO YOUNG Bulawayo-based author Mthulisi Ndlovu has released a book in which he fearlessly tackles the country’s highly-toxic political atmosphere. The book titled Politicking (Lockdown memoirs from within) was officially launched last week at a colourful ceremony in the city. The book is sincere and broad, covering a wide range of societal issues that include but are not limited to poverty, religion, systematic segregation, amongst others. “The unpleasant socio-political and socioeconomic situation in the country and Africa at large inspired the writing of this book. “It is about how people have been treated by their government(s) and how unscrupulous politicians have capitalised on people’s perils and enhanced corruption and unleashed excruciating low key terrorism on innocent citizens,” Ndlovu said. “This includes but is not limited to mistreatment of the general populace by some rogue State agents, abductions of peace loving fellow countrymen, women of courage, detention of journalists, suppression of media, human rights activists and ordinary citizens amongst others.” Ndlovu said the coronavirus pandemic also takes centre stage “as mismanagement of funds and underhand tactics have become increasingly common among those in power.” The book is the first project under Ndlovu’s newly-established publishing company called Ubuntu Afro Publishers. It was edited by Sebastian Sibanda while proof reading was done by Philani Nyoni and  Bhekilizwe Dube. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });  Ndlovu’s co-authored book Izinkondlo ezinhlobonhlobo is now a set book under Zimsec. His latest project is the sixth since he started writing. Sponsored Links
