 HARARE young triplets have been awarded a scholarship by President Emmerson Mnangagwa after they charmed him with their poem on the Consumer Protection Act.
This comes as the government officially launched the Consumer Protection Act in Harare on Wednesday where Mnangagwa was the guest of honour. The triplets; Anesuishe, Tanyaradzwanashe and Ruvarashe Chandavengerwa aged 10 are in Grade 5 at Crowhill Primary School in Harare. “To you girls, when you arrive at your home, please tell your mother and father that the president is now taking care of our fees up to the tertiary level,” Mnangagwa said while launching the Consumer Protection Act at a
local hotel. The Consumer Protection Act was signed into law in December 2019. It guarantees rights and obligations of the consumer and business. The triplets recited the poem to entertain and educate the attendees about the advantages
of the new law. Through their poem, the triplets highlighted that consumers, who make the largest bodyof people in the country, have been subjected to abuses and in some instances their rights were grossly violated by some unprofessional
service providers in commerce. At the event, the triplets effectively used arts to simplify a rather complicated subject, pointing out that the new law has come to give power to consumers over service providers much to the delight of Mnangagwa who was in
the company of his two vice presidents Constantino Chiwenga and Kembo Mohadi among other Cabinet
ministers. Accordingly, the new law strives to protect the consumer by ensuring a fair, efficient, sustainable and transparent marketplace for consumers and business. Sponsored Links
