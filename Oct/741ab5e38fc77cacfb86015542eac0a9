IF you have more than 100 followers on Twitter in Lesotho then you could be classed as an Internet broadcaster and have to register with the authorities, according to a proposal being considered.
The Lesotho Communications Authority (LCA) is currently asking for comments on the proposal. It defines internet broadcasting as “internet posts accessible to at least 100 internet users in Lesotho… and internet posts by users who have more than 100 followers in Lesotho”. By registering with the LCA, social media users will then have to comply with broadcasting rules, which could then mean that they would be subject to investigation if they are thought to have broken the rules. Twitter users in Lesotho — inevitably — are not impressed. – bbc.com Sponsored Links
