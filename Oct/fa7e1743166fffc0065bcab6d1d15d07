 THE Celebrate Africa music competition, celebrating traditional African instruments and talent-searching
their players, runs online from December 5-13, 2020. The auditions will be done in person in front of a panel of three judges with the viewers watching online. The brainchild of the competition is musician and arts innovator, Blessing “Bled” Chimanga with support from Alliance
Francaise de Harare. Chimanga said the competition uniquely focuses on musicians who play traditional African instruments and accompany themselves by singing in an African language. The winner’s prize is driven towards the advancement of perfecting their instrument-playing techniques and building a career. The winner will walk away with US$300 in cash, a professional studio recording and video of one song; a one-year music education scholarship at a local music school; a one-year mentorship and professional management programme with Chimanga and the Dreams Trust. Chimanga is himself an accomplished marimba musician, drummer and mbira player who has travelled widely in the world, proudly promoting his African instruments and music culture in a very modern way, and to much acclaim in countries in Europe and more recently Asia, as well as closer home in the region and around Zimbabwe. In the process of his busy career he has interacted and performed with artists from all over the world who
cherish their music culture, practice and promote it. Chimanga said: “What makes this competition different from the rest is the main focus on African music instruments, and for young musicians to learn to believe
in their true identity and sound. Our main focus is on upholding our cultural sound and creating a product that will be a model for cultural heritage for generations to come. Our culture, our instruments, our languages are special but it seems that as the younger
generation we have not been given enough creative material that can make us proud of who we are,
and our real African identity. There are players out there, but there’s a strong leaning towards western instruments too. We need to protect and promote our traditional instruments.” Sponsored Links
