 Vasco Chaya FOLLOWING the partial opening of the arts sector, Jasen Mphepo Little Theatre (JMLT) will resume operations tomorrow with the play Covid Chronicles. The JMLT says they are ready to re-open. “We will start with the play Covid Chronicles on October 29 and it will run through to October 31. On the day, we are going to make sure people have their face masks on, they are sanitised and have their body temperatures checked as part of the Covid-19 regulation measures,”  JMLT director Jasen Mphepo, pictured, said. Mphepo told the Daily News they have a number of new plays in store. “We have been working on new productions during the course of the lockdown and now we are able to run a new play every week,” he said. The director of the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (Nacz), Nicholas Moyo, has urged the artists and arts organisations to take advantage of this partial opening of the arts sector to engage in serious production. “As the sector is celebrating the relaxation of the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions which have seen the cultural and creative industries dormant for the past six months, Nacz would like to encourage players in the sector to take advantage of the relaxation of the lockdown to go back to their creative spaces and engage in serious production for the sector to recover some of the opportunities lost due to the coronavirus epidemic,” Moyo said. Moyo said after successfully lobbying for the sector’s reopening, Nacz implores industry players to put the health of practitioners and consumers of arts products at the forefront of their operations to avoid the sector becoming a vector in transmission of the deadly virus. “In this regard Nacz encourages artistes to establish and adhere to the set Covid-19 prevention protocols and standard operating procedures at all times as they reopen their creative spaces,” he said.
