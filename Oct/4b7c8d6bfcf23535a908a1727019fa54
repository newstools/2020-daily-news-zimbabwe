 Godknows Matarutse SPORTS WRITER marutseg@dailynews.co.zw CELEBRATED developmental coach Norman Taruvinga has emerged as the front runner to replace the late Biggie Zuze as the Dynamos assistant coach, the Daily News has leant. Zuze, who was a father figure in the Glamour Boys dressing room, passed away in Harare in June after suffering a pulmonary (lung) clot which resulted in his heart stopping. The former DeMbare midfielder, who was 56 at the time of his death, was buried in his home town of Bindura and Taruvinga, one of the highly-rated local junior coaches is reportedly the front runner to replace him. Taruvinga was an assistant coach to Patius Mauto when Prince Edward(PE) won the Copa Coca-Cola tournament last year in Kadoma and the Daily News understands Dynamos coach Tonderai Ndiraya regards him highly and has since recommended him to the executive. Ndiraya, who is currently deputised by Naison Muchekela, who joined the club at the beginning of the year and goalkeepers’ coach Gift Muzadzi, was recently sanctioned by the club’s executive to strengthen his technical department. Taruvinga is now the current head coach of PE and is credited for grooming some of the Premiership stars such as DeMbare trio of Tanaka Chidhobha, Albert Manenji and Nigel Katawa, Agiazo Magaya of FC Platinum as well as Ngezi Platinum’s Mandhlenkosi Mlilo and Malvin Kwinjo among others. While the Glamour Boys executive and Ndiraya were unwilling to give any details regarding the recruitment drive, sources inside DeMbare told the Daily News that Taruvinga is the preferred candidate. “Ndiraya is keen to work with him (Taruvinga). Ndiraya has a lot of respect for the guy and they go along very well. googletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1');}); “He will definitely be at Dynamos when football returns,” sources said. “The only problem is that he holds a Caf B licence but as you know clubs can apply to the association to allow him to sit on the bench. It’s something that is being taken care of.” DeMbare are looking forward to the resumption of football amid the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic with a lot of promise after they invested heavily in rebuilding the side that finished a disappointing 10th last season. Boosted by the financial support from their shirt sponsor Gold Leaf Tobacco through their Remington Gold brand, the Glamour Boys signed virtually a new team to do duty for them. The 2020 domestic football season should have commenced in March but it could not take off after the government banned all sporting activities and public gatherings of more than 50 people to curb the spread of Covid-19. Since then, teams have not been able to train with players only doing individual workouts at home. The government, has since allowed the Premier Soccer League (PSL) to resume in a phased manner and a mini league format. Sponsored Links
