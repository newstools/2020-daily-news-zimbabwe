 ALL is set for the third edition of the Zimbabwe Jazz Festival to be held today, the Daily News reports.
Unlike the two previous editions, this year’s event is going to be held virtually in line with the Covid-19 regulations. “This year’s edition of the Zimbabwe Jazz Festival will be coming to you in the comfort of your homes. This was made possible by our sponsors and partners,” said Filbert Marova, founder and coordinator of the event. The event, meant to showcase and promote jazz talent in Zimbabwe, is annually organised by the Zimbabwe Jazz Community Trust. “The event will be showing live on our Facebook page, the Alliance Francaise de Harare page and on the Yakontent page. It will be held from 4pm through to 8.30pm,” he said. Some of the musicians to feature in this year’s edition include Prudence Katomeni-Mbofana, Ngoma Ingoma,
Steve Chikotie, Rute Mbangwa, Bradley Sibiya Quintet, Filbert Marova and Friends, Buhle Ndlovu, Dudu
Manhenga and the Travellers among others. The pandemic has affected a number of events this year, forcing the bulk of them to opt for online shows.
Some of the high profile events held online include Shoko festival, Alick Macheso 52nd birthday celebration, Simon Chimbetu commemoration gig and Let Them Festival among others. This comes as the government put in place the Covid-19 national lockdown in March to curb the spread of the deadly pathogen. As a result, concerts were banned in the process as they tend to attract huge crowds. Since it was first detected in China in December, Zimbabwe has recorded 8 320 positive cases with
242 fatalities as of yesterday, Sponsored Links
