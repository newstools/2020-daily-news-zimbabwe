chayav@dailynews.co.zw CHITUNGWIZA dance group Extreme Dreamers were adjudicated the champions in the inaugural online Dance Off competition last week. Sesifikile dance group from Mufakose and Mbare’s Black Excellence were voted the first and second runners-up respectively, pocketing US$500 and US$250 accordingly. All the prizes were sponsored by Mashwede Village. “The event was meant to promote youngsters in the capital during this coronavirus national lockdown through arts. We are happy that the event went on well and we are now planning to host an online national event,” one of the event organisers Tendai Mashamhanda said. Meanwhile, due to the Covid-19 national lockdown regulations, most of the arts events have been held online as promoters and artists strive to adhere to the regulations of the lockdown. The government put in place the lockdown in March to curb the deadly pathogen from spreading.
In the process, people have been ordered to stay at home and minimise movement. Only essential workers have been exempted to work during the course of the national lockdown. As a result, artists have resorted to go digital for them to survive and keep on entertaining, educating and interacting with their fans. Some of the high profile arts events held online this year include Alick Macheso’s 52 birthday celebrations, Simon Chimbetu Commemorations and there are other events such as One Voice Concert, Shoko and Let Them festivals among others set to be held online in the coming weeks.
