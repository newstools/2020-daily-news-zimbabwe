chayav@dailynews.co.zw ARTISTS will hold a virtual memorial service for David Mungoshi, pictured, on September 26. A number of key speakers will participate. The event to honour the late veteran poet, educationist and actor who was laid to rest last week at his rural home in Chivhu, is being organised by Constance van Niekerk, who is a blogger at Afrique Beat-an entertainment lifestyle, arts and culture blog and a digital editor at Lekoa FM 91.0.  Van Niekerk was taught by Mungoshi at Mkoba Teachers college. “Mungoshi mentored a lot of writers. He inspired many. He was like the giant many looked up to, especially after many writers have gone. He was one of the very few left to guide us. “He deserves to be honoured. I know he once said he prefers honour while he’s still alive. Unfortunately, it is now coming when he has left, but this is our way of saying we appreciate all he did for us upcoming writers.”
