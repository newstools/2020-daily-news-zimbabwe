Vasco Chaya LIFESTYLE WRITER chayav@dailynews.co.zw  ZIMDANCEHALL chanter Jah Master is part of the performers to light up Shoko Festival slated for September 21 through to 27. Unlike the previous editions, this year the event will be held digitally in line with coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic regulations. “The list of confirmed performers billed to showcase at this year’s edition of the Shoko Festival include Jah Master, Poptain, Sibo Flysoul, Natasha Muz, Anita Jaxson, Black Pearl and Madzitatiguru among others,” one of the festival organisers Lerato Ndlovu said. More names will be revealed in due course, according to the organisers. The Hello Mwari hitmaker, who was born Rodney Mashandure, is currently celebrating a million hits on Youtube which has given him renewed vigour and he believes that with God everything is possible. The Chitungwiza-based Zimdancehall singer confirmed the popular song has opened doors of opportunities in his career. “I have many singles, they can number to over 60 but none of them have performed better than Hello Mwari. “The success of Hello Mwari has opened new opportunities in my career and it also gave me confidence to work extra harder in the music industry.  “My desire is now to continue churning out hits such that I can penetrate the big five,” he said. Shoko Festival, one of the country’s biggest and longest running urban culture festivals, is adding to the long list of annual events that have gone digital due in line with the Covid-19 pandemic regulations. Some other high profile events that have gone digital include the Delta Beverages-organised Braai Festival, Let Them Festival and musicians’ birthday bashes including those of sungura kingpin Alick Macheso among others. Last month, the Chimbetu family commemorated Simon Chimbetu digitally due to Covid-19 regulations. Recently, the Intwasa festival has been postponed to next year all because of Covid-19 effects.
