karongaa@dailynews.co.zw LADY Chevrons all-rounder Anesu Mushangwe underlined her dominance in the Australian Statewide Women’s Second Grade after taking home all the five accolades during last Friday’s banquet in Glenelg. Mushangwe, who is on the books of Glenelg Cricket Club, was crowned the best bowler at the club, the best bowler in the whole league and MVP. She also received a fourth award for a five-wicket haul she claimed for just two runs and was unbeaten with the bat on 59 runs in Glenelg’s win over Kensington on March 15. Mushangwe capped the fine night by claiming the renowned Lyn Fullston Medal, an award from the South Australian Cricket Association given to the top performer in the league. The top-order batter and leg-spinner received 34 votes, beating Kensington’s Monique Draycott and Keely Stone of Southern District, who polled 19 votes each. Lady Chevrons team manager Samu Nkiwane also praised Mushangwe for representing Zimbabwe in a positive manner Down Under. “As the Lady Chevrons, we are proud of her flying the Zimbabwe flag high.
“It’s what we encourage in each and every player to be good ambassadors,” Nkiwane told the Daily News.
Mushangwe should have returned home after the end of the season but has been locked down in Australia since the outbreak of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. She is using the free time to attain her coaching badges and has already completed Level 0 and Level 1.
Currently, Mushangwe is studying for her Level 2 certification.
