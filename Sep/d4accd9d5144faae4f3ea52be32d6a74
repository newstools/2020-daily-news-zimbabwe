matarutseg@dailynews.co.zw WARRIORS defender Teenage Hadebe has been rewarded for his solid performances for Yeni Malatyaspor after he was named in the Team of the Season by the Turkish Super League. Although Malatyaspor were relegated at the end of last season, Hadebe was the only shining beacon for the club in an outstanding debut season in the Turkish top flight. The former Chicken Inn and Highlanders centre back signed for Malatyaspor last year from South African giants Kaizer Chiefs. Luckily for Hadebe and his Malatyaspor teammates, their relegation was overturned after the Turkish Football Federation ruled that no club would be dropped from the top fight due to the challenges teams faced when the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic broke out across the globe. The other notable names on the Turkish top flight team of the year are former Liverpool defender Martin Skertl, who guided Istanbul Basaksehir to the title, as well as Congolese star Fabrice Nâ€™Sakala and Brazilian, Junior Caicara. Currently, Hadebe is being linked with a move from Malatyaspor with Besiktas and Trabzonspor, who finished second and third respectively last season, linked with a move for the Zimbabwean.
