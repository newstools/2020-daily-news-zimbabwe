 COMEDIENNE and socialite Felistas Edwards aka Mai Titi has penetrated Nigeria’s Nollywood after featuring in a new Sirbalo Comedy skit titled Sugar Mommy. The skit was released on August 29 and is showing on both Mai Titi and Sirbalo Comedy social media pages. The mother of two told the Daily News more collaborative work with foreign actors is in the pipeline. “Most of my plans have been negatively affected by the Covid-19 national lockdown. Had it not been Covid-19, I would be far by now.” Mai Titi charmed the Nigerians thanks to her recent Covid-19 skit. While Mai Titi has more than half a million followers on social media, the Nigerians (Sirbalo Comedy) have over two million. Also known as Empress Feli 1 in the music industry, Mai Titi, apart from acting, has lined up some interesting collaborations with international musicians including Yondo Sister, among others. Some of her music videos have received a fair share of airplay on international television channels such as Trace Africa TV, an Afro-pop music channel dedicated to airing the continent’s top music videos mainly from African musicians. However, Mai Titi is more like the late Safirio Madzikatire aka Mukadota who was more popular as an actor than a musician. Some of the songs by the Top Female Entertainment and Social Media Enterprise Business Leader of the Year award winner include Utange Neni, Makatendeka, Dzora Mwoyo, Kereke Dhukeke, Ndinouya Ikoko, I Miss You, Dzoka Undinyepere and Letting You Go featuring Kazz Khalif among others. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });
