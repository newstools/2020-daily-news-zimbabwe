mhlophes@dailynews.co.zwTHE Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) has described the Tripartite Negotiating Forum (TNF) as a monumental failure and a disappointment which has left workers reeling from poor remuneration, the Daily News reports.  This comes as the labour movement has mobilised its members to embark on lunch-hour protests every Monday to push for United States dollar-based salaries in light of the struggling economy.  Speaking during a workers’ dialogue forum hosted by the ZCTU online recently, ZCTU secretary-general Japhet Moyo said the TNF had proven to be a failure due to the government’s lack of political will to implement the recommendations made through the platform.   “Fast forward to the end of May, we also agreed that we had given the government enough time to stabilise the currency and that is a conversation that is on record within the TNF.  “We agreed that the government has to reform our currency and instead of taking that issue, the government decided to introduce the auction system, ignoring completely what is coming up from the TNF,” Moyo said.   “How government is supposed to provide adequate transport for essential service workers and testing, but government decided to apportion testing to private players when we had agreed that the government should do it.  “In terms of how the TNF has fared, it has been a huge disappointment. The TNF has not lived to its expectations. The government has ignored the TNF when it comes to crafting policies and implementing resolutions from the TNF,” Moyo added.  He further described the living conditions of workers as indicative of a deep crisis in the country.
This comes as the government has refuted claims that there was a crisis in the country, saying it was a creation of “detractors” on an anti-government campaign.  “You are in a crisis when people have been locked down at home as containment measures for coronavirus (Covid-19) without anything to eat or feed their families. We are in a crisis when we have thousands, if not millions of young people, risking their lives crossing Limpopo to South Africa where there are no jobs. You have a crisis when you are sleeping at home barricading your home because you are afraid that someone is going to come and abduct you.  “It is a crisis when workers are unable to petition their employees to get better wages. If you put all these things together there is no other description you can give except to say we are really in a crisis,” he said.  Sponsored Links
