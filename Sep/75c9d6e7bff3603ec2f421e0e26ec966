Bodybuilding contest, Marume Classic, organisers hope the event will come back stronger next year after the 2020 edition was postponed due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.  Covid-19 has had a negative impact on the local and global landscape since March when most governments closed borders and imposed lockdowns.  Since March, all local sporting events have been banned as the government tries to minimise the spread of the novel virus.  However, in recent months the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) has been allowing certain low-contact codes to resume under strict health guidelines.  While bodybuilding has been given the green light to resume, the Marume Classic will not take place this year. Launched in 2017, the privately-run contest was now a regular feature on the local bodybuilding calendar with athletes and fans looking forward to it.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); Last year, Nunurai Masosonore claimed the title while Gideon Teguru was crowned champion the previous year. Event founder and four-time Mr Zimbabwe winner, Givemore Marume said they are now working around the clock to ensure the contest gets international recognition when it bounces back.  “We have now grown the brand to be recognised across our borders, we have managed to bring a different concept in our sport and above all transparency when dealing with our athletes and sponsors which has seen us retaining them every year.  “In terms of shortcomings, I think it’s high time we own a sound system, bring in at least three big main sponsors and promote the event at shopping malls,” Marume told the Daily News yesterday.  Marume said in order for the contest to grow according to their projections, it will require the luring of high-calibre bodybuilders by offering an attractive purse.  “We need to work on a good model for our judges and continue working with the Zambian national association as well so they continue to bring in their athletes for competitions.  “We need to grow regionally and attract athletes from countries such as Botswana, Mozambique and Namibia…,” he said.
