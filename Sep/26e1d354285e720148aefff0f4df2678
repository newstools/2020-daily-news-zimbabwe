 SUSPENDED Zesa Holdings(Zesa) executive chairperson Sydney Gata, has bounced back at the power utility after a directive from President Emmerson Mnangagwa, the Daily News reports.  This comes after the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc) cleared Gata of four out of six abuse of office allegations he was facing when he was suspended with his entire board by Mnangagwa on August 6.  Mnangagwa also reinstated the board. In a statement yesterday, chief secretary to the President and Cabinet Misheck Sibanda said Zacc’s investigations had covered issues around the Intratek Gwanda Solar Project, the Mutare Peaking Plant Project, the conduct of the former Energy minister Fortune Chasi and officials in the ministry in their dealings with Zesa.  “At the commencement of the Zacc investigations, the executive chairperson, (Dr S) Gata was accused of six acts of misconduct namely: self-allocation of six vehicles for personal and family use, authorising an expenditure of $10 million Christmas parties in Hwange and Kariba in 2019 without board approval, unilaterally installing solar equipment at his residence in Borrowdale using Zesa funds, setting up a Trust called ZEIST to undertake several Zesa projects, interfering with disciplinary process, in particular that of… Norah Tsomodo, the company secretary of the Zimbabwe Power Company Pvt Limited and allegedly authorising the payment of ghost employees and his personal workers on Zesa under the misrepresentation that they were employed by Zesa.  “The interim report cleared Gata of the first four allegations. With regards to the last two allegations, Zacc is yet to conclude,” Sibanda said in the statement.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); He added that Zacc was still investigating the conducts of other Zesa board members although Mnangagwa gave them permission to resume their duties.
