ZIMBABWE’S Warriors will now take on the Flames of Malawi in a friendly international in Blantyre next month, the Football Association Malawi (Fam) has announced.  “The Flames will play friendly matches against Zambia and Zimbabwe during the Fifa International window next month.  “The Flames will travel to Lusaka for the match against Zambia on October 7, 2020 before hosting Zimbabwe at the Kamuzu Stadium on October 11, 2020,” Fam said in a terse statement yesterday.  Initially, the Warriors had been invited to take on the Harambee Stars but the Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) took too long to respond to the Federation of Kenya Football (FKF).  The preparatory match against the Flames will give Warriors coach Zdravko “Loga” Logarusic and his players a much-needed workout ahead of the resumption of the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });  The matches should have taken place in March but were postponed following the global outbreak of the coronavirus (Covid-19).  Since then, there has been no international football on the continent as most countries closed their borders and imposed lockdowns.  Logarusic, who was appointed Warriors coach at the start of the year to replace Sunday “Mhofu” Chidzambwa, is yet to take charge of an official match.  At the time sporting events were banned, the Croat was busy preparing his squad of locally-based players for the Chan finals.  Earlier this month, Logarusic told the Daily News of his desire to at least have one preparatory match before facing the Desert Foxes. “It’s important to have at least a friendly match before we play the qualifiers to help us have an idea on players that we can select for those crucial matches.  “I understand the federation is working on something because we discussed it. Friendly matches will help us have an idea of what to expect from our players. I’m not really looking at the type of opponents; the important thing will be for us to play,” Logarusic told the Daily News yesterday.  The Warriors currently sit in second place in Group H with four points after a drab goalless draw against Botswana before defeating Zambia 1-2 in Lusaka.  Algeria have a 100 percent record after mauling Chipolopolo 5-0 and edging the Zebras 0-1 in Gaborone.  This means whoever gets the upper hand in the two meetings between the Warriors and the Desert Foxes in November will gain total control of the group and will have their place at the final tournament in Cameroon in 2022 probably secured.  While the Warriors will be taking on Malawi to prepare for those mouth watering clashes, Algeria have secure two preparatory games against Nigeria and Mexico. Sponsored Links
