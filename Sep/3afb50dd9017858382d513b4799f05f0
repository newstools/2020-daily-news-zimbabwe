HARARE City Council has said it is working hard to ensure that all health workers at its institutions return to work.
Health personnel in the country, including government workers, have downed tools in the wake of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, demanding better remuneration and personal protective equipment (PPE). The city closed several of its clinics as a measure to contain the spread of the virus and last week, announced that 17 clinics had been reopened. These include Kuwadzana Polyclinic, Mufakose, Wilkins and Beatrice Road infectious diseases hospitals, Hatfield, Mabelreign, Tariro Satellite and Hatcliffe. However, there has been a sceptical response from the public, who claim some of the institutions are not operational. Council clinics provide several services to the public, including maternity, and their closure has been a huge disadvantage for many who can not afford private facilities. In another matter, the city said it is working to resume normal door-to-door refuse collection after a three-week backlog owing to a fire outbreak at the main dumpsite, Pomona. The city announced that the fire had been contained and it was waiting for certification from the Environment Management Agency (Ema) to resume operations. It said currently, garbage is being disposed of at Golden Quarry. “Council advises that the fire at Pomona Dumpsite was successfully suppressed on 31 August. Preparations to resume normal operations at the dumpsite are in progress upon certification by Ema. Meanwhile, a blitz operation to clear backlogs that emanated from the two-week non-collection period commenced on Saturday 29 August. When done, normal door-to-door collections will resume,” the city said in a statement.
