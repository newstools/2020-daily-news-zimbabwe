chayav@dailynews.co.zwGOVERNMENT has pulled the plug on a planned Kariba Summer Cruise and Beach Party set for the resort town on September 25 and 26 as the arts and entertainment sector remains closed in line with the coronavirus (Covid-19) national lockdown regulations.  The event targeting 200 guests was set to be powered by several DJs, among them MC Abisha Palmer, MC Bigdollar, MC Iroq, DJ Candyman, DJ Youngfresh, DJ Andie Browns, DJ Professor, DJ FreeB and Selecta Odza.  To attend the Summer Cruise and Beach Party, individuals had to pay between US$100 and US$150 for accommodation, meals and entertainment among others.  However, director of Arts, Culture Promotion and Development in the ministry of Arts, Biggie Samwanda said it will be illegal to hold such a festival with this Covid-19.  “As far as I know, arts activities have not yet been allowed to take place in the country due to Covid-19 pandemic.  The government is yet to open the sector to the public,” said Samwanda.  The National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (Nacz) concurred with the ministry of Arts saying the sector remains closed.   Ruwende added that he was still analysing the event’s poster to ascertain the profile and status of the promoters behind the event. “We want to see their status in terms of registrations with the council.”  Organisers told the Daily News yesterday that the event was approved by the ministry of Tourism.   While efforts to obtain a comment from the ministry of Tourism were fruitless by the time of going to print yesterday, the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) told this publication they have no problem with businesses bouncing back as long as they do so under strict Covid-19 regulations.   He encouraged tourism operators to always work hand in glove with the authority during this Covid-19 period.
Government reopened tourism last week after almost half-a-year of closure due to the pandemic.
