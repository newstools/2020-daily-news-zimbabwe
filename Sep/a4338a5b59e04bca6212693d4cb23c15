TRIATHLON Zimbabwe (TZ) is delighted after they were granted permission to host a second event since the March 31 Covid-19 national lockdown.  The 2020-21 TZ season was curtailed when the government invoked a nationwide lockdown in March and banned all sporting events from taking place as a precautionary measure.  However, TZ were granted permission to host their first event last month which went according to plan at the Mount Pleasant Triathlon Course on the 20th of this month.  The next triathlon race is taking place at the same venue on October 4, with TZ spokesperson Carol Pakenham expressing excitement on the development.  “Great news everyone — approval for our next event has been granted so all systems go for Sunday 4th October. “There will be a couple of slight changes to the operations which we hope will make the flow even smoother so keep checking your e-mails towards the end of the week and we will let you know when online registration opens,” Pakenham said in a statement.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); After the successful staging of the first event, TZ hope this forthcoming meet will be even more successful as more young triathletes are taking up the sport.  “Thanks for the constructive comments received — these will be taken into consideration and we will be making a few changes to improve the next event…  “It is so encouraging to see the new crop of youngsters making their way up the ranks and all aspiring to be the next Matt Denslow or Andie Kuipers or Laurelle Brown — having seen these little guys and girls progress from Trikidz to where they are today makes us so proud,” Pakenham said.
