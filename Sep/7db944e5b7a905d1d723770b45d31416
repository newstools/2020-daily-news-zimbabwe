THERE has been a lot of posturing and public stunts, among many other signals from Zimbabwe’s political leaders on how to solve the political and economic crises affecting the country. With a delegation from South Africa’s liberation political party, the African National Congress (ANC), expected in the country today for talks with their Zanu PF counterparts, it is important to exhort the leadership to do the right thing. The subject of talks has been topical as Zimbabweans itch for a solution to the country’s myriad challenges. As such, it is no mean business but has to commit all our minds and thoughts.
In a way, the talks should not just be talks for the sake of it if they should produce an acceptable as well as sustainable outcome. But these talks must, first and foremost, be genuine. They must be driven by a genuine desire to see an end to the suffering that has now become perennial for the people of Zimbabwe.
For a very long time now, Zimbabwean society has been heavily polarised and as such any envisaged talks must be sincere, with trust ranking as the central premise. Anything short of this may prove counter-productive for Zimbabwe given the country’s diverse interest groups.
