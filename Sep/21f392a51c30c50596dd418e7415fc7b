 VETERAN educationist, poet, actor and writer David Mungoshi, pictured, succumbed to pulmonary embolism, a post-mortem has revealed. Mungoshi died on Saturday at the age of 71. According to online medical journal Healthline, pulmonary embolism is a condition in which one or more arteries in the lungs become blocked by a blood clot. According to the Mayo Clinic, it results in the death of one-third of people who go undiagnosed or untreated. Symptoms include shortness of breath, chest pain and cough. Prompt treatment to break up the clot greatly reduces the risk of death. Tadiwa said burial papers are now in place. “We are now just waiting for the arrival of close relatives from the United Kingdom. He will be buried in Chivhu, our rural home,” he said. A former University of Zimbabwe linguistics lecturer, Mungoshi’s works include The Fading Sun, Stains on the Wall, Broken Dream and Other Stories and Live Like an Artist. Mourners are gathered at Number 3 Umguza Close, Wilmington Park in Cranborne in Harare.
He is survived by wife Emma, six children and 12 grandchildren.
