IT SEEMS speculation linking Warriors midfielder Marvelous Nakamba with a move away from English Premier League side Aston Villa will not die down before the end of this current transfer window.
This time around, Nakamba has been linked with a move to Turkish giants Galatasaray and Fenerbache, who are all looking to sign him on loan before the close of the October 5 transfer deadline. After signing for Villa last season from Belgian giants Club Brugge, the Warriors star started the previous campaign as a key player in manager Dean Smith’s side but saw his opportunities become more limited in the Premier League due to Douglas Luiz’s impressive performances in the anchorman role in midfield. Towards the end of last season, the 26-year-old was largely a squad player as he only came on in the final minutes to help Villa finish out matches during a frantic relegation battle. When Villa began their 2020-21 Premier League season last Monday, Nakamba was on the bench throughout the game as the Birmingham-based side won 1-0 against Sheffield United. The previous week, he had started and put in a good shift in the Carabao Cup 1-3 victory over Burton Albion.
On Thursday night, the Zimbabwean was back in the Villa starting line-up when they beat Bristol City in the Carabao Cup. With his starting place in Smith’s strongest line-up no longer guaranteed, Galatasaray and Fenerbache feel they will be able to work out a deal with Villa for the Zimbabwean. Fenerbache in particular are optimistic they will get the deal done since they have established a good working relationship with Villa. The Turkish side yesterday announced the signing of Nakamba’s Villa teammate Mbwana Samatta on loan.
The two clubs have agreed a fee of £5,5 million for Samatta’s substantive transfer after that, which could rise to a maximum of £6,2m with add-ons, and Fenerbahce have announced they have agreed a four-year contract with the Tanzania captain. Samatta joined Villa from Genk in January on a four-and-a-half-year contract and scored two goals in 16 appearances in all competitions last season. However, the Tanzanian’s opportunities would have been limited this season after Villa signed Ollie Watkins from Brentford for an initial club-record £28 million fee, potentially rising to £33 million in add-ons and forward Bertrand Traore from Lyon. “I know how big a club Fenerbahce is. I am happy to be here in such a family because it will be a new and big challenge for me. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); “Fenerbahce has a lot of supporters and they always want to win. I also want to win. I came with this request, I am very happy and I hope we will win many trophies,” Samatta told the Fenerbache website yesterday.
With at least 10 more days before the transfer window closes, it will be interest to see how Nakamba’s situation plays out at Villa. The Zimbabwean has shown that he is a valuable option to have on the bench for Smith and come on in and provide a different dimension for Smith’s midfield later on in the game. But at the same time, Nakamba is at a stage in his career where he needs to be playing regularly hence going to Turkey seems an viable proposition. Sponsored Links
