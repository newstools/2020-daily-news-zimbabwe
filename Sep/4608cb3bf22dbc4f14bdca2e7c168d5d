HARARE – Premier Soccer League (PSL) boss Kenny Ndebele has welcomed the proposal by the government to introduce a “bio-secure” bubble concept for football to return during this coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. The government is currently working on a roadmap with the Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) and other relevant stakeholders for the resumption of local football, with clubs having been inactive for the past nine months. Earlier this week, the government revealed they want local football to adopt a bio-secure bubble model in order for the domestic season to be allowed to finally commence and has since given Zifa a proposal for consideration. The 2020 local football season should have kicked off in March but was postponed after the government banned all large gatherings and sporting events to curb the spread of the novel virus which has had devastating effects on the sporting world. “We welcome the suggestion from the government to have the bio bubble concept. “We are just waiting to hear from those responsible to see if it’s feasible and how soon we can start. “Otherwise as PSL, we are ready to start. We are just waiting on the approval of protocols. “The competition aspects can be dealt with once clubs are given the green light to start training. “What is important is for teams to start training and everything else will fall into place. “Once the protocols are approved then we can go to our partners and tell them how things will pan out,” Ndebele told the Daily News. The government banned all sporting activities in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); While other sporting disciplines have been allowed to resume light activities, football and other full contact codes are yet to get the green light from authorities.
