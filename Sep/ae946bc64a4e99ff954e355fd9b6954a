ZIMBABWE limited overs captain Chamu Chibhabha has had to endure a long wait before he can lead his charges for the first time in an international assignment due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Since March, local cricket has been suspended after the government imposed a nationwide lockdown to combat the novel virus. In June, the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) classified cricket as a low risk sport, paving the way for the national team players to resume training. However, all the series the Chevrons were preparing for against Australia, India and Afghanistan were cancelled as the pandemic continues to spread. After local cases continued to rise, Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) was then forced to suspend activities. All this misfortune means Chibhabha, who was named interim skipper for the shorter version of the game at the start of the year, is yet to lead the team in any match. “We have tried to train as a team…trained for a couple of weeks and as you know the number of cases started to go up again and we had to pull off practice. “I’m not sure when we are going to start practising again or get any cricket so we can only hope and pray that something good is going to happen soon. The 33-year-old is well-aware that the Covid-19-induced delay has robbed him of the chance to get more games under his belt as captain. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); “Such is life but the most important thing is for us to look after ourselves, stay healthy and remain positive and in the right frame of mind such that if we are to be called for duty today we are mentally, physically and spiritually prepared.”
