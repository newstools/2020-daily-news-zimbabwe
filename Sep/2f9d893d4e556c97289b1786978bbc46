HARARE – Former Warriors and Dynamos forward Edward “Duduza” Sadomba said he was overwhelmed by the warm welcome he got from Al-Hilal fans on his arrival in Sudan last Friday. The 37-year-old returned to the Sudanese capital exactly four years after leaving Al-Hilal. This time around he was not there as a player but he accompanied the duo of Last Jesi and Silas Songani, who are set to be unveiled tomorrow by Al-Hilal. Instead of the Hilal fans going crazy over the arrival of their new players, it was the sight of an old face that sent them into delirium at Khartoum International Airport. There was jostling from people, both young and old, as they wanted to catch a glimpse of Sadomba and take a selfie with their idol. Others simply wanted to shake the Zimbabwean’s hand and thank him for all the memories he created during his days with Al-Hilal. Sadomba has a lot of good memories with the club where he became a terrace favourite during his two stints with the Sudanese giants, scoring an incredible 98 goals in 90 appearances across all competitions, between 2009 and 2013. Despite not making a crack in European leagues, Sadomba left a lasting legacy on the continent and even won the Golden Boot in the 2011 African Champions League and the 2012 African Confederation Cup playing for Al-Hilal. In fact, the Mbare-born ex-footballer is revered in Sudan where is considered an Hilal legend. The normally reclusive Sadomba tries hard to shy away from the spotlight but he had no choice but to engage and rekindle the old memories with his fans in the Sudanese capital. “I’m humbled by the reception I got here. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); “It is great to see such a massive crowd welcoming me at the airport. I am forever grateful for their unconditional love, it means a lot to me. “There were so many people waiting for us at the airport. It was nice meeting all these people for the first time in four years. “A lot of people came, from former teammates, friends and fans; I was deeply touched by the love,” Sadomba told the Daily News from Khartoum yesterday. In fact, Sadomba has not had any rest since his arrival in Sudan with requests to meet him coming from all over and even from high-ranking places. “Since I arrived here, I have been receiving calls and invitations from even some government officials. “It shows they appreciate my contribution to the club during my time here. It actually reminded me when I was still playing here. “We had a lot of memorable moments,” he said. With Jesi and Songani waiting for their unveiling at Hilal tomorrow, Sadomba has a word of advice for the pair. “Everything is going on well and they should be unveiled on Tuesday (tomorrow). I think they have seen what it means playing for Al-Hilal. “They have seen it for themselves and I’m sure they will work hard to be accepted by the club’s followers,” Sadomba said. Having spent the last seven years in Europe, Songani was a marquee signing for FC Platinum at the start of the year and big things were expected from him. The former Warriors winger only featured in one competitive match for Pure Platinum Play when he netted a brace against Highlanders in the Castle Challenge Cup final back in March. Jesi had shown plenty of quality last season with Manica Diamonds and that’s why FC Platinum had done everything to sign him on loan. However, Jesi had two outstanding performances for the Zvishavane-based side against Hilal in the African Champions League earlier this year. From that moment, the Sudanese giants had been monitoring his situation. Sponsored Links
