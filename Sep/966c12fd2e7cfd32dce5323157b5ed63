HARARE – Despite being confident hosting the Warriors’ 2022 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) Group H qualifier against Algeria on home soil, the government is still to complete all the necessary renovations requested by Caf at the National Sports Stadium (NSS) and Barbourfields Stadium. Caf earlier this year banned Zimbabwe from hosting international matches due to dilapidated and outdated match venues. Caf inspectors gave adverse reports following their visit to the two venues which left the Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) in a spot of bother. In March before the outbreak of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the Warriors were supposed to take on Algeria in back-to-back qualifiers. The Warriors were supposed to play their home leg of the qualifiers at Orlando Stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa. Luckily for Zimbabwe, the two matches against the reigning African champions were postponed as Covid-19 brought the entire world to a standstill. Following the debacle, the government released resources to ensure the necessary renovations to the NSS and Barbourfields to begin immediately. Zimbabwe has to act quickly though after Caf recently announced the rescheduled dates for the qualifiers with the Warriors now set to take on the Desert Foxes between November 9 and 17. There has been significant progress at the NSS where the dressing rooms have been fitted with modern seats, cabinets, air condition, more toilet seats, flat screen television sets and proper lighting. Medical rooms for both the players and the public have also now been furnished with the necessary equipment and furniture. The playing surface which had suffered and looked bumpy in recent years is also looking immaculate and well-manicured. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); A big and well-equipped press conference room filled with new desks, chairs and flat screens televisions is now complete as well. Crucially though, the government is yet to secure bucket seats and the automated turnstiles for both venues which were two of the major reasons for the Caf ban. The government had hoped to import the equipment from China but the due to travel restrictions brought by Covid-19, it is no longer possible. Sports minister Kirsty Coventry said they have now taken the route of sourcing locally the bucket seats and automated turnstile system. “We have done some very good improvements to the stadia. We are waiting on the report from the Zifa technical committee. They went around over the weekend to do an assessment and they will be sharing with us and Caf. “There are still the outstanding things which is the ticketing, the turnstiles and the bucket seats which we are working on; it’s in the stage of procurement. “We all know that Covid-19 has hit all of us for different reasons and we will just wait to see what’s written in the report and how quickly the procurement can be done. “There are different tenders that are being sent out to see if at all seats and all things can be produced locally. But it will come back to what the financial requirement is and how quickly can we make work,” Coventry told reporters during a media briefing in the capital on Monday evening. While it seems there is some progress taking place on the renovations, another pressing matter though remains ensuring local football finally returns amidst the current pandemic. Since March, the domestic season has been on hold after the government banned all sporting activities to stop the spread of the virus. In order for the game to resume, the government has suggested for Zifa and the Premier Soccer League (PSL) to adopt a bubble concept. It is important for the local game to resume in order for Warriors coach Zdravko “Loga” Logarusic to have all selection options available for the Algeria matches. There is a huge possibility that some foreign-based stars might not be allowed to feature in those qualifiers after Fifa announced that its no longer mandatory for clubs to release player for national duty due to Covid-19.
