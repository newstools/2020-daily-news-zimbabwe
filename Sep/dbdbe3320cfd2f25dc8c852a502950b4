GOSPEL diva Fungai Zvakavapano-Mashavave’s penchant for fine cars is conspicuous! And she doesn’t brag about it! Living in the leafy suburb of Borrowdale in the capital, the songbird seems to be enjoying life to the fullest, if material things are to be taken into consideration. Time and again she changes luxury cars. Recently, she posted a photo on social media showing her new BMW convertible car for the summer season. She captioned it: Summer Yadzoka Zvekare (Summer is back again!). Sometime last year, Fungisai was involved in a road accident while driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee on her way to Chipinge, a small town about 180km south of Mutare in Manicaland. The accident came after she had survived yet another accident in the capital while driving a Mercedes Benz. The Toita Zvedenga hit maker however, could not reveal the exact number of cars she drives. She also reminded me that she does not rely entirely on her music. “I am a marketing executive with TN Beverages. I keep chickens and do a lot of gardening,” said the diva, who holds a Masters’ Degree in Child Sensitive Social Policy from the Women’s University in Africa. With the coronavirus (Covid-19) national lockdown taking a toll on the majority of local artists, the mother of three says: “Faith is what enables me to beam the brighter side of life no matter how compromised it can be. “We all have our fair share of negatives but I specialise in creating a world of hope by celebrating breath. At least ndamuka ndichifema saka ndotangira ipapo ndichitenda Mwari (If I woke up alive, then I will start from there, praising God) and the rest God will take care of,” she said.
