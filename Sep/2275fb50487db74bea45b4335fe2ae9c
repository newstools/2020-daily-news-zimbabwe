karongaa@dailynews.co.zw ZIMBABWE elite men triathlete Matthew Denslow has left for the United Kingdom to study International Business at the University of Bath. Denslow made his elite debut for Triathlon Zimbabwe (TZ) at last year’s Bonaqua Troutbeck Triathlon Africa Cup finishing eighth. Switzerland’s Andrea Salvisberg won gold, Dimtry Polyanskiy of Russia settled for silver while South African Jamie Riddle took bronze medal. His departure for the UK comes hard on the heels of leading junior women’s ace Andie Kuipers’ move to the United States last month on a triathlon scholarship. Kuipers enrolled at the Lenoir-Rhyne University in North Carolina where she is pursuing a degree in Exercise Science and Dietetics. TZ spokesperson Carol Pakenham said Denslow will take the opportunity to work towards securing qualification for the 2024 Olympic Games to be held in Paris. “We are really sad to see you leave Zimbabwe, but we know that you will work hard, train hard and do your very best in every aspect of this new adventure. “Matt will have opportunities, where possible, to race at ITU European and North African ATU events and hopefully he will be able to come home and race at Troutbeck 2021; Paris 2024 is his main aim. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); Denslow was devastated to miss out on the Triathlon Junior World Championships held in Switzerland last August.
Having performed exceptionally well in February of the same year where he won the junior men category at Troutbeck Africa Cup but a tyre puncture in Mauritius in June cost him a place for global showcase. Sponsored Links
