in BULAWAYOORGANISERS of Intwasa Arts Festival koBulawayo have postponed the 16th edition of the multi discipline arts fiesta due to Covid-19 lockdown restrictions.  The annual arts jamboree was initially scheduled to take place this month-end.  In a statement yesterday festival director Raisedon Baya said the prohibition of gatherings left them with no choice but to move the dates forward.   “However, despite the shelving of the main festival, Intwasa will host events digitally on social media platforms.
“Should the lockdown restrictions be relaxed, Intwasa Extra will be held in December,” he said.  Intwasa Arts Festival koBulawayo is an annual platform that celebrates the diversity of human cultures and creation in such disciplines as music, spoken word, theatre, dance, literary arts, fashion-and crafts.  The festival which usually attracts artists and art lovers from all over the world has become part of the city’s calendar.  The Covid-19 pandemic has seen almost similar events being conducted virtually with the most notable one being the recent Bulawayo Arts Festival.  Organisers of the annual Bulawayo Arts Awards have also set a date for a virtual ceremony before the end of the year.  However, recently, the Kalanga Language and Cultural Development Association also cancelled the 2020 edition of Luswingo Kalanga Cultural Festival which was slated for October in Tokwana village, Bulilima District in Plumtree.
