The virtual event is being organised by Edzaisu Trust in commemoration of International Day of Peace, a United Nations-sanctioned holiday observed annually on September 21.  “We have invited a number of artists from different art genres such as acoustic music, poetry, comedy and theatre among others to showcase on the day.  “The event will be held online in line with Covid-19 national lockdown regulations,” one of the organisers of the event Tafadzwa Muzondo said.  The event will screen on Facebook from 12 noon and it will feature musician Tendai Mavengeni, comedian Edgar Langeveldt, poet Mbizo Chirasha, Yahweman, Zvido Zvevanhu, Nasibo and Chioneso among others.  “Every month we host the online Bira Renhetembo to commemorate a special day in society.
“The forthcoming event is our second edition. On the first edition, we were commemorating the International Day of the Disappeared on August 30.”  Owing to effects of Covid-19, virtually all the arts events have gone digital. Some of the events lined up to be held online include the annual Delta Beverages-organised Braai Festival, Let Them Festival and Shoko Festival.  In June, musician Alick Macheso celebrated his 52 birthday bash online while last month the Chimbetu family commemorated Simon Chimbetu digitally due to Covid-19 regulations.  Recently the Intwasa Festival was postponed to next year all because of Covid-19 effects.  Sponsored Links
