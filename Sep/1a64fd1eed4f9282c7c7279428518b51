ZIMBABWE cricket team interim captain Chamu Chibhabha says the mood in the team’s training camp was immediately lifted after the government granted them permission to go ahead with the tour of Pakistan on Wednesday.   Since March, all sporting events were put on ice after the global spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19).As a result, the government also banned all national teams from taking part in any incoming or outwards tours.However, in recent weeks, there seems to have been a drop in the numbers of those infected by the novel virus and the international sporting calendar is getting back to normal.Zimbabwe is scheduled to travel to Pakistan for three ODIs and three T20Is with the first game taking place on October 30.Before ZC could confirm the tour, they needed to get approval from the government.And on Wednesday, the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) wrote to ZC giving them the green light.With the 25-man provisional squad for the tour already in camp anticipating to get the nod, the mood was lifted once the news broke.“It was a huge relief getting the green light to go to Pakistan considering that we missed out on Afghanistan earlier this year because of the pandemic.“The guys are excited and you can see from the attitude they are showing in practice now; there’s more purpose because we know we are travelling,” Chibhabha told the Daily News yesterday.Despite the long lay-off, Chibhabha is confident they still have enough time and quality to compete against the Asian nation.“I think we have got a really balanced team considering that we have the senior players and the youngsters getting into the team.“They (youngsters) could learn a lot from the senior players and then also it just goes to show that ZC’s future is in good hands because there’s a lot of youth coming in so the future is looking good, Chibhabha said.Zimbabwe training squad: Faraz Akram, Ryan Burl, Regis Chakabva, Brian Chari, Tendai Chatara, Chamu Chibhabha, Elton Chigumbura, Tendai Chisoro, Craig Ervine, Kyle Jarvis, Luke Jongwe, Tinashe Kamunhukamwe, Wesley Madhevere, Timycen Maruma, Wellington Masakadza, Brandon Mavuta, Peter Moor, Carl Mumba, Richmond Mutumbami, Richard Ngarava, Sikandar Raza, Milton Shumba, Brendan Taylor, Donald Tiripano, Sean Williams.
