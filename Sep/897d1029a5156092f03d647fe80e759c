CRIMINAL Investigation Department (CID) boss, Crispen Charumbira, will spend the next fortnight in remand prison following his court appearance on corruption charges yesterday.
Charumbira, the national director at the CID, allegedly interfered with lawful arrests by ordering his subordinates to abort some criminal investigations. He was represented by Tabson Bvekwa and Sylvester Hashiti when he appeared before Harare regional magistrate Marewanazvo Gofa. He elected to apply for bail at the High Court after prosecutor Michael Reza had indicated that the State was opposed to bail. The State’s main fear was that considering Charumbira’s “influential” position, he would interfere with investigations and witnesses if released. The team reacted to the information and subsequently arrested him, before a search was conducted leading to the recovery of 443g of dagga. When he heard that Magolise had been arrested, Charumbira allegedly called Ndlovu — instructing him to release him. However, the team did not take heed of the instructions and took him to Harare Central for docket compilation, after consultation with the officer commanding CID Drugs, Harare. The court also heard that when Charumbira arrived at Harare Central, he allegedly summoned the arresting team to his office and pleaded with them to release the accused person. After realising that the team was not yielding to his demands, Charumbira became emotional and ordered them out of his office. The two detectives laid an ambush at the spot, leading to the arrest of Violet and Kelvin Muzondo after they had collected the two sacks of dagga. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); They were taken to Harare Central for further investigations, but Charumbira allegedly instructed Moyo to release the suspects — an order that he refused to comply with. The following day, Moyo met the then assistant commissioner, Charumbira, who accused him of being big-headed and quizzed him as to why he had refused to comply with his instructions. On the last count, it was alleged that in February this year detectives in Manicaland received a tip-off that David Cosby of Mutare was in possession of illegal gold and diamonds. Charumbira allegedly caused the crack team to abort the operation and report back to their stations. This comes as police commissioner-general Godwin Matanga has transferred a number of senior police officers in recent weeks — with some of them being re-assigned out of the capital city after being mired in allegations of corruption. In recent weeks, several high-ranking police officers have also been arrested and arraigned before the Harare Magistrates’ Courts over allegations of graft — ranging from abuse of office to receiving housing stands from alleged land barons.
