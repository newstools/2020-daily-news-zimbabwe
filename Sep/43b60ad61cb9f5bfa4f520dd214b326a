IN 2009, the late former Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai appointed then MDC national organising secretary Nelson Chamisa to head the Information Communication Technology ministry in which capacity he served until the end of the inclusive government in 2013.  The late former president Robert Mugabe at one time acknowledged the work the youthful minister was doing then.  During his time in Cabinet, the then Kuwadzana East Member of Parliament shared the same boardroom at Munhumutapa offices with Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was Justice Minister then before being moved to the Defence ministry.  The two used to share some lighter moments in Parliament and they were believed to be only political opponents and not enemies. Videos and images in which the two were joking and laughing together are awash on the Internet.  When Mnangagwa and Chamisa took over as leaders of Zanu PF and MDC Alliance respectively, many people hoped the two’s affability would push them to engage in serious talks for the betterment of the ailing nation. President Emmerson Mnangagwa Moreover, Chamisa’s lawyer Thabani Mpofu also “legitimised” the November 2017 military coup by representing two applicants at the High Court, arguing that the army’s intervention was necessary on the basis that Mugabe was no longer in a position to make independent decisions. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });  Dialogue between Chamisa and Mnangagwa, many felt, was inevitable and the generality of Zimbabweans were prepared to work together.  Many wonder what has changed, apart from one being the Head of State, and the other being the main opposition leader in the country.  Do these two gentlemen and the parties they lead need foreign mediation for them to meet in their own country? Mnangagwa argues that Chamisa must recognise him as the legitimate head of State for him to consider engaging him on the negotiating table. On the other hand, Chamisa says the legitimacy issue should form the basis of dialogue between them.   The two leaders must sit down and talk, whatever it takes because this is what could bring back smiles on citizens’ faces.  Those who can sweet-talk the two leaders to talk must do so while prayer warriors, on the other hand, should go into the mountains to pray for peace in our country.  On March 9, 2018, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and the leader of the main opposition, Raila Odinga, publicly shook hands and agreed to work together.  It did not take foreign conciliators for the two to achieve such a commendable milestone. Now there is political stability in Kenya and their economy is growing rapidly and the environment is conducive for investors.   I, therefore, call upon Chamisa and Mnangagwa to start talking to each other. The two are legal minds and we believe they speak the same language.  They must understand they are both Zimbabweans and hence their actions should be pro-people. We want sincere talks between the two political parties and home-grown solutions to prime the country for growth and stability.  The political and economic crises obtaining in the country can only be resolved through candid dialogue.
