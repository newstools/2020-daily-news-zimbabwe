 FILM production organisation Slimaz Production has launched a new drama aimed at creating gender-based violence (GBV) awareness. The drama is titled Mai Boi and premiered yesterday on their Youtube channel. Mai Boi story revolves around a youthful lady who is married to an older man. The lady is gainfully employed unlike her husband. As a result, the lady goes on to abuse the man despite her age. Producers of Mai Boi told this publication they have opted to premiere the drama online as it is cheaper as compared to television. “Unlike our drama Tunga which was showing on Zbc TV, we have opted to launch the Mai Boi on our Youtube channel to cut costs. ZBC sells airtime to us the producers hence we need to source adverts to run during that slot for us to keep afloat. Considering how the economy is performing, it is a challenge to source the adverts.” The drama comes at a time when the country is under coronavirus national lockdown where there has been an unprecedented increase in GBV cases. Recently, the Children’s Performing Arts Workshop (Chipawo) re-launched their theatrical play Secrets of a Woman’s Soul which revolves around gender-based violence. Southern African Development Community (Sadc) Gender Protocol Barometer 2020 revealed that 68 percent of women in Zimbabwe have experienced gender-based violence while 46 percent of men have perpetrated violence against women. This also comes as the Musasa Project recently revealed that its centres have assisted over
10 000 violence survivors since the beginning of the Covid-19-induced national lockdown. “Across the region, GBV service providers reported a surge in cases within the first week of lockdowns and over subsequent days. In Zimbabwe, Musasa, an agency that normally provides support to about 500 GBV survivors each month, recorded more than 700 GBV cases in the first week of lockdowns,” read the report presented on the side-lines of the just-ended 40th edition of the Sadc Heads of State Summit.
