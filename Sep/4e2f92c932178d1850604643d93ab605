masakadzab@dailynews.co.zw CHIEF magistrate Munamato Mutevedzi yesterday said magistrates across the country will undergo training to improve the quality of judicial output. He said they were looking at improving the decisions that come out of the magistrates’ courts such as judgments and sentences. Several judgments and sentences have been taken up for review and some have been overturned at the High Court.
Mutevedzi was speaking on the sidelines of a swearing-in ceremony for four new magistrates at the Harare Magistrates’ Courts. The four who took oath of office are Talent Mutasa, Caroline Matanga, Blessings Tsingano and Busani Sibanda. “We are working to increase and improve the quality of judicial output, the quality of judgments, sentences and all other decisions coming out of the magistrates’ courts. We are going to be conducting quite a number of trainings around the country for every magistrate to keep on improving our work,” he said. On the operations of the court during the coronavirus (Covid-19)-induced lockdown, Mutevedzi said they have managed to keep the courts open and operational. He said there have been challenges such as failure by some witnesses and accused persons to attend court due to transport challenges, but they have managed to remain operational. The chief magistrate said the four new magistrates would also help reduce the case backlog. Mutevedzi also implored the Judicial Services Commission to increase the number of regional magistrates from 33 to at least 50.
