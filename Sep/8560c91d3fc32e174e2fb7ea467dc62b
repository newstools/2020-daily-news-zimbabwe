chayav@dailynews.co.zwEPWORTH-based sungura and jiti musician-cum-comedian Freddy Manjalima aka Kapfupi, pictured, will soon release a new gospel track titled Nhoroondo.  The track which is expected on the market next week comes barely a week after gospel musician Mathias Mhere released a song with a similar name and lyrics.  Nhoroondo is a rhythmic traditional gospel song which is popular and sung in many churches.   Several other gospel groups such as Voices of Norton and AFM Greater Harare Praise among others have released their own versions of the traditional song.   In the song, Kapfupi literally preaches the message of good news, quoting the Bible in the process.  “My job is to give hope to the hopeless society. A lot is happening in our society such as the Covid-19 pandemic which affected people directly and indirectly. Medical practitioners and other professional people have tried their best to curb the problem but above all, God has the final say,” Kapfupi said.  Kapfupi is the latest musician to join in the Covid-19 fight. Some of the musicians who have released songs of hope during this Covid-19 national lockdown period include Cashmore Muchaonyerwa, Gemma Griffiths, Janet Manyowa and Agartha Murudzwa-Ndembera.
