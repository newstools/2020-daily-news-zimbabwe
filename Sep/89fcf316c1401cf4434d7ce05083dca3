karongaa@dailynews.co.zw FORMER Footballers’ Union of Zimbabwe (Fuz) administrator Marlene Gadzirayi has introduced the Run for Cancer September fitness challenge to raise awareness on the disease and its effects on patients. Gadzirayi recently beat the disease and has now dedicated her life to inspiring other cancer patients so they can have the courage and hope to fight. In this latest challenge, she is urging individuals to run at least 5km a day and help raise awareness regarding cancer. She said the main aim of the challenge is to increase awareness on cancer and its effects on the lives of ordinary Zimbabweans. “We all have at some time in our lives lost a parent, sibling, child, relative or friend from the scourge of cancer. A big event would be great provided it will be more than just a marathon.”
