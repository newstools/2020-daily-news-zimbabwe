 LIFESTYLE WRITER SOUTH Africa-based Zimbabwean gospel singer DJ Rabaaz will tomorrow launch a video on social media to mark his 49th birthday day. Titled Awesome God, the video confirms DJ Rabaaz’s rising stock as a gospel musician of note. “This video — Awesome God — is a way of celebrating with my loyal fans who have stood by me and supported me all the way. “I’m greatly inspired by Grammy nominee King Isaac with whom I once worked in Mambakwedza Band led by mbira maestro Sydney Maratu back in the 1990s. “As I celebrate my 49th birthday, Wasaririra — which I released some time back is — for the 4th week in a row — leading the pack in the Classic 263 gospel charts show. “I am currently working on a new album to be released later this year although a single — All is Well — will come first. I would want to thank God for affording me the opportunity to spread his word through music,” the Chitungwiza-born singer said. A second year Bible School student with Christian Family Church International led by Theo Wolmarans, DJ Rabaaz says people must believe in God for all multi-skills He has given us already. … Coronavirus (Covid-19), of course jolted the world but we must believe and see beyond it. for it is defeated already. The Wasaririra hitmaker — who grew up in Chitungwiza although he is now based in SA —added that social media is the only way for musicians at the moment but data costs are prohibitive. “Network service providers must come to the party and make data tariffs affordable for all to access content.
“Social media now plays a key part given lockdown challenges. Many are not able to access the content they would want to as this is affecting everyone from kids to elders. “Our Lord Jesus Christ is already at the corner for anyone facing any life challenges for through Him unto the Lord, all things are possible.” googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });  Rabaaz, who was born Claud Rabison at St Mary’s Clinic in Chitungwiza, is not new to music having played with seasoned artistes from the 1990s, including Mambakwedza Band — formed at the Zimbabwe College of Music led by mbira maestro, Maratu — the Bulk Spirits, Noel Zembe, the late Franco Hodobo, Isaac and the Mozambican duo of Theresa and the late Awendile. The artiste is married to Sharon and the couple has two kids, Sean and Shalom.
DJ Rabaaz has released two other gospel albums before titled Tariro and Tendeuka as well as Ndaiwana Shamwari and continues to minister through gospel music. Sponsored Links
