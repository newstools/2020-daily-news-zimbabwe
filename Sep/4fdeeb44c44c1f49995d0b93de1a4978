mashayab@dailynews.co.zw THE government will extend its payment of a monthly US$75 coronavirus allowance to civil servants up to the end of the year, the Daily News reports. This comes after Finance and Economic Development minister Mthuli Ncube announced recently that the government was in talks with its employees, with a view to improving their remuneration and other conditions of service. The council is the umbrella body for civil servants’ unions. Yesterday, it met with the government under the auspices of the National Joint Negotiating Council (NJNC) — where the employees pressed for the continuation of the allowance. The government introduced the three-month allowance in June this year, whereupon it was also extended to State pensioners who were given US$30. The allowance was introduced at a time when civil servants were demanding their salaries in hard currency, arguing then that the prices of goods and services were skyrocketing. Besides agreeing on the allowance, yesterday’s NJNC meeting still ended in a deadlock on salary negotiations. Efforts to get a comment from Labour minister Paul Mavima last night were unsuccessful.
Civil servants are demanding to be paid a minimum of US$550 a month, which is equivalent to what they were getting in October 2017. Recently, teachers’ unions said if the government failed to address the issue of their salaries and their multiple concerns on Covid-19 measures, they would not go back to work when examination classes open next week. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); Schools were closed in March, shortly before President Emmerson Mnangagwa imposed a national coronavirus lockdown.
