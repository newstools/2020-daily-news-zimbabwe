 OF LATE there has been a wave of interpretations of the governmentâ€™s stance on land reform, with most suggesting the President Emmerson Mnangagwa administration is reversing one of the key gains of the post-independence era. Although the government has been very clear on what is currently happening, there is a deliberate ploy to misinform the public to gain cheap political mileage. Traditionally, the MDC never supported the land reform programme when it took place around 2000. However, in a stunning volte-face, they are today some of the most vocal in claiming that the Zanu PF government is reversing it. For the MDC, the current issues surrounding land seem to provide an opportunity to slam Zanu PF, but obviously this is being done from positions bereft of proper conceptualisation of what is going on. It is important to note that funding has always been the major stumbling block for compensation for improvements on farms, a programme that has always been on the cards. Some properties covered under Bilateral Investment Protection and Promotion Agreements (Bippas) had unfortunately been occupied during the land reform programme, sparking conflicts with several countries, are also set to be restored to their former owners once the government is convinced this will not upset existing social setups. What the government is merely doing is righting some of the wrongs made during the processes at the turn of the millennium. The Mnangagwa government cannot be nailed for doing something that would contribute towards the normalisation of relations with the previously hostile nations mainly in the European Union and the United States.
