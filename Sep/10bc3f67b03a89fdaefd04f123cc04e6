in BULAWAYO THIS yearâ€™s The Eminent in Sports, Music and Academic Awards (Tesma) second edition will take place in December at the Gwanda District Club. The awards which were launched last year in the small mining town are specifically meant to recognise the distinguished efforts of usually overlooked people in their various fields in Matabeleland South Province. While the inaugural event had 20 categories covering the Gwanda District, this time the organisers increased them to 32, hence covering the whole of the province. The awards recognise outstanding students, teachers, artists and athletes who have put the province on the map through their hard work and excelling.
