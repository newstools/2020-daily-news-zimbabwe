machakairet@dailynews.co.zw POLICE have separately arrested three suspected carjackers who recently attacked motorists before fleeing with their cars. The trio has been identified as Obedience Mombeyarara, Justice Mabiso and a 16-year-old juvenile. Mombeyarara has already appeared in court charged with one count of robbery of a motor vehicle and was remanded in custody to September 10, while the other are yet to be arraigned for prosecution.
On June 28, Mombeyarara allegedly hired a taxi to Seke and when they got to Monyoro Village he ordered the driver to stop and produced a knife, threatening to stab him. He allegedly ordered the driver to surrender his car, a Honda Fit, and Mombeyarara drove off, leaving him stranded in Seke. Investigations by CID Marondera led to Mombeyarara’s arrest and recovery of the car in Chitungwiza.
Circumstances surrounding the juvenile’s case are that on August 5 in Mbare, the complainant left his car open with the keys on the ignition as he went into his house. When he returned after 20 minutes, the car was gone and a report was filed at Matapi Police Station, leading to the minor’s arrest and recovery of the stolen vehicle. Mabiso was arrested in Harare after the person he sold a car stolen from Karina Service Station in Norton tried to have it registered. “Motorists are being urged to exercise due diligence at all times.
“Avoid picking up strangers and leaving keys in the ignition port.
“Taxi operators are encouraged to scrutinise their customers,” national police spokesperson Paul Nyathi said in a statement.
