FC PLATINUM have been dealt another huge blow ahead of their participation in the African Champions League after Sudanese giants Al-Hilal came back to raid them for highly-rated winger Silas Songani.  The platinum miners were hoping to make a huge impact in this year’s campaign having failed to go past the group stages in the previous two attempts and Songani is one of the players who they had hoped would help them reach the knockout stages.  Pure Platinum Play have already lost another star midfielder Last Jesi who joined Al-Hilal at the weekend. FC Platinum communications manager Chido Chizondo confirmed Songani’s imminent departure for Khartoum yesterday.   “And it’s a huge blow for us, two key players we were banking on are gone,” Chizondo told the Daily News. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); The 30-year-old had been in Denmark for the past six seasons after initially joining Superliga side Sonderjyske in 2014.  Songani spent four years at the club before he was finally released on loan to Sydvest where he had been for the past two seasons.  The 2013 Soccer Star of the Year first runner-up returned to Zimbabwe at the start of the year and signed for Pure Platinum Play.   The former Harare City winger showed his class when he guided the platinum miners to a convincing 2-0 win over Highlanders in the Castle Challenge Cup earlier this year.  Songani’s first half brace made the difference as the Zvishavane-based side clinched their third straight Castle Challenge Cup prompting many to call for his inclusion in the national team.
