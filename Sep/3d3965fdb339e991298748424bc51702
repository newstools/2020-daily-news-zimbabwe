 ZIMBABWE cricket star  Sikandar Raza is looking forward to taming Pakistan in their own backyard when the locals tour the Asian country next month for a limited overs series, subject to government approval.  Raza was born in Sialkot, Pakistan where he dreamt of being a fighter pilot but failed an eye examination and his relocation to Zimbabwe saw him take up a different fight with the bat and ball.  The Zimbabweans, in 2015, became the first full member nation to visit Pakistan since the Sri Lankan cricket team terror attack in March 2009.  It was a largely competitive series with Zimbabwe on several occasions getting close to winning encounters. Raza scored an unbeaten 100 from 84 balls, hitting eight boundaries and three maximums in the second ODI that Pakistan won by six wickets with 16 balls left.  Raza remembers the 2015 series vividly. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });  “Last time we toured Pakistan we took them to the wire and the last game which was rained off, we were on track to win it. “So, good performances from me and the team is what I am praying and hoping for. “The mood (in the Chevrons camp) is fantastic and everyone feels great to be out training and being part of the national team training camp,” Raza told the Daily News yesterday.  The 34-year-old is still basking in the glory of winning the Caribbean Premier League title with Trinbago Knight Riders (TKR) where he was useful with his off break taking seven wickets in seven matches.  “It feels amazing to win the trophy with TKR. “It was such a privilege to be part of that family. “So many vital lessons were learnt.  “How a winning culture is formed, how off the field bonding helps on the field and how clear we were about our roles before the tournament started so all that helped,” Raza said of his Caribbean excursion.  Meanwhile, Zimbabwe Cricket chairperson Tavengwa Mukuhlani is also hopeful that the scheduled tour of Pakistan will be cleared by the government.  The Chevrons are scheduled to leave Harare on October 20 with the official matches commencing in November. However, the government banned all Zimbabwe national teams from touring due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.  “From a sporting point of view, the only sport that can raise the flag of the country in the face of Covid-19 is cricket so it’s good for the image of our country to be able to tour,” said Mukuhlani.5 Sponsored Links
