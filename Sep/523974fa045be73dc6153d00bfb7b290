 WARRIORS coach, Zdravko “Loga” Logarusic says he is not surprised by Zimbabwean striker Prince Dube’s blistering start to life in the Tanzanian Premier League with Azam FC.  The former Highlanders forward scored twice in the second half against Coastal Union on Friday evening at Azam Complex Stadium in Dar es Salaam to guide his club to a second straight victory in as many matches.  This followed his impressive debut last week in which he provided an assist that saw Azam win 1-0 against Tanzania Police in their opening fixture courtesy of an Obrey Chirwa solitary strike.  And on Friday, Dube continued with his form in a game that also featured his compatriots Never Tigere and Bruce Kangwa, to earn plaudits from his national team coach.  It was a well-taken brace from the 23-year-old as he produced two close-range finishes to send his team top of the log with six points before yesterday’s matches.  Loga, who is currently holed up in his native Croatia due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, is already planning for the forthcoming 2022 Afcon Group H back-to-back qualifiers against Algeria that are set for November. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });  There is no doubt that when those matches against the Desert Foxes finally come, Dube will be pushing for a starting place in Loga’s team if he continues with his current form.   “He provided an assist in his first match and scored twice in his second game. I’m not really surprised by his start to life in Tanzania.  “Of course, it’s too early but there is no doubt he has shown he is a quality player and I expect him to continue doing well. This is good news for the country especially ahead of our Afcon qualifiers against Algeria soon,” Loga told the Daily News on Sunday.  On his part, Dube was excited to get off the mark and hopes to keep scoring for his new side going forward.   “I want to give those fans what they want, give everyone around Azam what they deserve so it is about doing my best for the team.  “I wish to continue scoring more goals. Whatever will happen at the end of the season, I will be grateful. For me I just want to help the team, they welcomed me with love and I have to give them what they deserve,” Dube told the Daily News on Sunday from his Dar es Salaam base.  The Warriors will resume their Afcon Group H qualifying campaign with the blockbuster encounters against the Desert Foxes between November 9 and 17.  Loga and his team will then complete their campaign with matches against Zambia and Botswana between March 20 and 31 next year.  Currently, Zimbabwe sit second in the group with four points following the 0-0 draw with Botswana and the 2-1 win over Zambia.  Algeria top the pool with a 100 percent record after thrashing Zambia 5-0 and edging Botswana 1-0 which makes the November meetings with the Warriors crucial for both sides.  Besides being impressed by Dube’s early-season form for Azam, Loga is also following the progress of all the players in his plans with keen interest.  The Croat also watched Warriors forward Tino Kadewere make his Ligue 1 debut for Olympique Lyon in a goalless draw against Bordeaux on Friday evening.  “I’m following most players. I also watched Kadewere he was introduced as a second-half substitute and played 18 minutes.  “I’m sure he will start to have more minutes very soon,” he said. With Loga very unlikely to select local-based players for the upcoming qualifiers, the performances and form of the Warriors’ foreign legion are crucial at this juncture.  Since March, the government has banned all sporting activities in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19. While other sporting disciplines have been allowed to resume light activities, football and other full-contact codes are yet to get the green light from health authorities.  Loga hopes the government will at least allow local clubs to start training when they make an announcement tomorrow as expected. Sponsored Links
