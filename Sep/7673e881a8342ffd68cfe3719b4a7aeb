THE government has, through Statutory Instrument (SI) 223 of 2020, gazetted regulations for the resumption of inter-city travel, which will see operators applying for the routes they want to service to the Commissioner of Road Motor Transportation.  This comes as the government is relaxing Covid-19 lockdown measures to allow for the resumption of various economic activities, including inter-city travel and tourism.  “With effect from the 20th September, 2020, the operator of any passenger service vehicle may ply intercity routes, subject to the following conditions — the Commissioner of Road Motor Transportation will assign a temporary registration number (for the duration of the national lockdown) to operators approved under this section, and specify which inter-city routes the operator is registered to ply; it is a condition of registration under paragraph (b) that operators will comply with any applicable guidelines issued by the minister of Health from time to time (taking into account WHO guidelines on the operation of public passenger transport),” read part of the regulations published yesterday.  The gazette also gave legal effect to the increased number of people who can gather for worship from 50 to 100 adults.  “…. any business in the formal commercial and industrial sector… is permitted to open any time between 0630 hours and 1830 hours, and the patrons thereof shall comply with subsection (6) as if they were spectators at low risk sports events,” it added.
