tafirenyikam@dailynews.co.zw THE continued push by Pretoria to help Zimbabwe overcome its decades-long political and economic crises has created an air of optimism among opposition parties, civil society groups and the Church, the Daily News reports. In addition, the welcome decision by Zanu PF this week — to allow South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) to meet with local opposition groups and other key stakeholders in future — has further raised hopes that the much-needed and much-talked about national dialogue may finally be on the horizon. This comes as President Cyril Ramaphosa and the ANC are showing admirable fortitude as they bid to end Zimbabwe’s deepening myriad challenges — which once again hit international headlines recently after authorities were accused of gross human rights violations by government critics. This week, Ramaphosa dispatched a high-powered ANC delegation to Harare led by secretary- general Ace Magashule, for crucial bilateral talks with Zanu PF. Yesterday, the opposition, civil society organisations and clerics told the Daily News that the visit by the ANC bigwigs was good news for the country. The convener of the Citizens Manifesto, Briggs Bomba, said the most welcome thing about the Zanu PF and ANC meeting was the admission by both parties that Zimbabwe was facing significant challenges — “even though semantics were deployed to avoid using the word crisis”. On its part, the MDC Alliance said the visit by the ANC’s heavyweights was a sign that South Africa was concerned by Zimbabwe’s ongoing problems. The Church also said it welcomed South Africa’s attempts to bring Zanu PF and other key stakeholders together, to settle their differences for the good of the country. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); The secretary-general of the Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe (EFZ), Blessing Makwara, told the Daily News that the visit by the ANC’s top brass was important in terms of laying the foundation for national dialogue. However, the secretary-general of the Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC), Kenneth Mtata, said a lasting solution to Zimbabwe’s challenges should be locally constructed, with neighbours giving solidarity. “Zimbabweans must, collectively, find consensus on problem-definition, possible solutions and mutually acceptable processes towards realising those solutions. The meeting between Zanu PF and the ANC came as the calls for President Emmerson Mnangagwa to hold national talks with all key stakeholders have now reached a crescendo — in the wake of Zimbabwe’s deepening political and economic crises. This comes as more details of the meeting between the two parties are emerging, with sources telling the Daily News yesterday that Zanu PF had produced a 27-page security document to dispel the allegations of human rights abuses by the government. On Wednesday, other sources had told the Daily News that the talks between Zanu PF and the ANC had been very candid and robust, with all the niggling issues put on the table. Addressing the media after their arrival in South Africa yesterday, Magashule said they were determined to “bring the Zimbabwean people together”. He said the meeting with Zanu PF was “a very candid, frank and honest discussion”. South Africa and its leaders — including former presidents Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma — have in the past successfully mediated Zimbabwe’s political crises. A decade ago, both Mbeki and Zuma helped to broker the stability-inducing 2008 government of national unity between opposition giant Morgan Tsvangirai and former president Robert Mugabe — who are both late — following the hotly disputed 2008 presidential election. Zuma also assisted in minimising Zimbabwe’s chaotic approach to the equally disputed 2013 national elections. Sponsored Links
