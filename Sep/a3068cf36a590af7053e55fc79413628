THE World Health Organisation (WHO) has released a raft of measures it says governments must follow before and after they reopen schools for face-to-face learning, the Daily News reports.  Among the measures is the ‘‘stay at home if unwell policy’’ which seeks to discourage ill students from attending classes until they are certified fit by doctors.  This comes as the government is involved in a bitter row with teachers after it allowed schools to reopen this week for students writing examinations this year.  In a report yesterday, the WHO backed the reopening of schools, but insisted on a number of safety guidelines for learners and teachers to curb the spread of Covid-19.   “In terms of screening and management of potential patients, they should create a checklist for parents, students, staff to decide whether they can go to school, with due consideration for the local epidemiology of Covid-19. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); “The checklist should include underlying medical conditions and vulnerabilities, to protect students and staff,” WHO said yesterday, among other recommendations.  This comes as local authorities have been accused by teachers of rushing to partially reopen schools without satisfying the WHO guidelines for safe teaching and learning.  Public schools will reopen on September 28 for Zimsec examination classes, while Cambridge classes started on Monday this week.  In a scathing letter to authorities last week, Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ) secretary-general, Raymond Majongwe, said educators were shocked that their input and advice to stop the reopening of schools was ignored.   He said the fact that no covid-19 cases were recorded in schools during the June exams was because no one was ever tested.  Teachers also said the majority of schools in rural areas were the least prepared to open this month. Sponsored Links
