 HARARE – Award winning gospel musician Togarepi Chivaviro is happy with the progress his son Tinashe has made in the music industry. This comes after Tinashe recently launched his second single Zvataitirwa Nenyasha. “I’m so happy about the young man. He is finding himself now. As for recording, I’m doing less and less as he brings on board his own flavour and followership. I am also happy noting that he actually plays a lot of instruments. I am convinced he will be more of a complete musician than me,” the Ebenezer hit maker said. Chivaviro who is currently in the United States of America, told the Daily News plans are there to feature Tinashe on his forthcoming studio album. “I will only be back in the studio after my studies end of November; surely my first recording will feature him. I wanted him to set foot first, make his own name in the music industry as Tinashe Chivaviro, and then it will make sense for me to collaborated with him,” he said. Tinashe has joined the long list of children of music legends who follow their parents’ footsteps. The list is made up of the likes of The Charambas daughters Shalom and Eternity who launched their separate singles on July 10. This comes after Alick Macheso’s daughter Stacey has recorded the track called Ingozi without the help of her legendary father. The song talks of an avenging spirit that is wreaking havoc in the family, causing problems including sicknesses, fights in the family and general social upheavals which resulted in the failure of the head of the family to sleep at his home. The singer urges family members to come together to solve the problem by appeasing the spirit. Stacy is the last daughter of Macheso and Nyadzisai. She is in form three at St John’s Chikwaka.  Other children of the veterans who have made it big in the industry include Suluman Chimbetu, Tryson Chimbetu, Selmor Mtukudzi, Tendai Chimombe and Gary Tight among others. Sponsored Links
