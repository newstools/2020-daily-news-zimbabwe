 AGNES Ncube is a gifted young actress from Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, who discovered her passion for theatre in high school. She grew into the industry and took it up professionally under the Centre for Talent Development, with which she enjoyed her first tour beyond her home city. Agnes engaged with Nhimbe Trust’s Women in Theatre and Television programme in 2017 in the ‘Unified Women’ cultural exchange project with Young Vic Theatre (UK), and appeared in the 2018 production ‘Blood Tongue – The Musical’ which was met with wide acclaim and in which she toured out of Zimbabwe for the first time, to a festival in South Africa. Her performance earned a first nomination in the Bulawayo Arts Awards 2018. Other plays Agnes has acted in include ‘Fragile’, ‘The Witch Hunters’ and ‘Imbokodo’ – for which she earned a nomination for Outstanding Theatre Actress in the National Arts Merits Awards. She’s also had a taste of film and other media through skits on television and radio. Most recently Agnes appeared in the play ‘Vagina Monologues Africa’ produced by Bulawayo’s Intwasa Arts Festival. We don’t stop working, and I hope that more such productions will come about, more innovative things, more learning from this  situation, because it will help develop our careers in the process.  I’m also hoping it doesn’t stop here; that there will be more work of this kind in this unique new theatre environment.”
