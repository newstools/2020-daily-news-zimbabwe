 LIFESTYLE WRITER ARTS promoter Exevia ‘Wezhaz’ Maoneke has been awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters (DHL) degree in recognition of his philanthropic work and support for local arts as CEO of Wezhaz Investments. Maoneke said he felt humbled given that whatever he has been doing for humanity over the years was purely out of his desire to give back to the community and reach out to the less privileged. Maoneke has over the years continued to do a lot for the community through arts promotion as his Wezhaz Bar in Warren Park where he gives a platform to both upcoming and established artistes. He is also supporting disadvantaged kids in his rural home of Chivi, Masvingo with tuition fees. The doctorate degree conferment which took place on Tuesday at a Harare hotel was courtesy of The International Institute of Philanthropy in partnership with International Women’s University and Maverick University. Maoneke who is the founding Vice Chairperson of Zimbabwe Business and Business Hub (Zibah) was joined other respected business people and luminaries among them Wezhaz Investments CEO Exevia Maoneke, Theresa Nyajeka of Zuva Petroleum, and Jospeh  Kaseke of Strike Security who were accorded the same honour for their sterling work in community development and humanitarian service. An executive of the International Institute of Philanthropy said: “The Institute believes that the practise of philanthropy can never be attained academically and at any juncture as such this positive approach is wholly justified as philanthropists and humanitarian practitioners or individuals who practise philanthropy are born and live a life of practising philanthropy. “This invariably means that the only form of recognition, respect and honour that can truly reflect their intellectual, philanthropic practical expertise, gesture of acknowledgement and qualification can only be attained through the conferment and attainment of the Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters Degree.” Sponsored Links
