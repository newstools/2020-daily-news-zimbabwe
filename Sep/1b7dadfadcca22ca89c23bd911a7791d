MUTARE-based gospel musician Blessing Shumba will launch his forthcoming studio album, Heal Our Land online on September 25. “The album will be launched on social media in line with the regulations of the national lockdown. It talks of God’s grace,” Shumba said. The album talks of healing, hope and faith. “This is my eighth album and we are still finalising on the exact number of tracks to put on it.
“It is my hope the album will go a long way in giving hope to the hopeless society especially this time when the world is grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic,” Shumba said. The album will be accessed on online music stores and social media platforms. “As we are in the digital era, our products will be accessed on social media platforms such as YouTube, Spotify, Amazon, Twitter and online stores among others so that our fans from different parts of the country can easily access it,” he said. The musician who is also into business said the purpose of gospel music is to transform society. “The idea of preaching is to change society. As preachers, we strive to reach everyone in the communities.
“We have released a number of albums with different messages and this year we have decided to preach healing, hope and faith message,” he said. Shumba cut a niche in the music industry at a tender age, taking part in church choirs before joining forces with his family members in an accapella group called Vakushi Veshoko. His family members quit the music industry due to the harsh economic environment in the country, leaving Shumba behind. He forged ahead to form Holy Psalms of Mutare and recorded solo album Ishe Wazvose in 2008.
The album is composed of plug songs such as Kurwa Kwakanaka among others. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); Shumba then went on to launch other commercially successful studio albums in the form of NdiMwari, Shongwe, Calvary, NdiJesu and My Season among others. In 2015, Shumba was voted the top musician on annual Coca-Cola Radio Zimbabwe Top 50 with the song Chimwe Nechimwe off the album NdiJesu. Sponsored Links
