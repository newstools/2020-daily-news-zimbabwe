 CORRUPTION busters in President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s office have swooped on Criminal Investigation Department (CID) national director Chrispen Charumbira over a slew of allegations relating to graft.  The Daily News understands that Charumbira was being held overnight at Rhodesville Police Station in Harare. This comes as police commissioner general Godwin Matanga has transferred a number of senior police officers in recent weeks — with some being re-assigned out of the capital city after being mired in allegations of corruption.  Well-placed sources told the Daily News last night that Charumbira was nabbed yesterday by the Special Anti-Corruption Unit (Sacu) in the President’s Office, after some junior officers filed complaints relating to abuse of office and attempts to obstruct justice.  Some of the allegations include trying to secure release from police custody of suspects caught with drugs such as marijuana, and shielding those alleged to be illegally dealing in gold and diamonds. The impeccable sources also told the Daily News that allegations against Charumbira went as far back as 2015, when he was the then CID Harare co-ordinator.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); He has been accused of causing the transfer of three detectives (names withheld) who had busted people found in possession of dagga.  Among other claims, Charumbira was said to have allegedly ordered the detectives to release the suspects because they were “his close associates and thus by arresting them it would be a sign of being disrespectful to his designation in the organisation”.  The sources also said Charumbira was facing a slew of further allegations relating to barring detectives — including those he had allegedly caused their transfer — from carrying out a raid on a suspected gold and diamonds dealer in Manicaland.  Head of Sacu, Thabani Vusa Mpofu, was not answering his mobile phone last night, while national police spokesperson Paul Nyathi was also not reachable.  In recent weeks, several high-ranking police officers have been arrested and arraigned before the Harare Magistrates’ Court over allegations of graft ranging from abuse of office to receiving housing stands from alleged land barons.
