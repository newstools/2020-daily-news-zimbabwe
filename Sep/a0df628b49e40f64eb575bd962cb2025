 UGANDAN born televangelist Elvis Mbonye has called for the unconditional reopening of churches, describing worshipping as an essential service. With several countries, including Zimbabwe, moving to ease Covid-19 lockdown measures, the Harare domiciled preacher said churches must not be left out. Mbonye, who broadcasts his sermons on national broadcaster ZBC, urged preachers to speak with one voice in calling for the return of normal church services. He said with the virus affecting several sectors, including churches, ministries adapted to alternative evangelism such as streaming prayer services online.  He said several people were plunged into fear following the outbreak of the virus resulting in phrases such as the “new normal” and that church leaders should not be on the forefront of living in fear. He also raised the debate between science and faith in the fight against the virus. “It will be very disheartening if God happens to come and find his people are being taken away by the logic and deception surrounding the virus.” Sponsored Links
