© SONGSTRESS Gabrielle “Afrikka” Kundiona says she has decided to relocate from Malaysia to pursue music locally as a way to reconnect with her roots. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); She said she learnt a lot while in the Asian country and feels she has what it takes to change the course of Zimbabwean music.
On Friday she released a new single With Love, Mother and today she will be dropping another single Dzepfunde which features another songstress Ects. “I have decided to come back home and reconnect with my roots and connect with Africa as my name Afrikka suggests after years in Malaysia. It is now time to change the look and sound of our Zimbabwean music,” she said. Daughter to educationalist Cleopas Kundiona, Afrikka said in February she will be releasing her debut album and engage on a familiarisation tour, taking her music to the people starting with universities. “I’m not new on stage. When I was in Malaysia I was more of a performing artiste, doing covers for other musicians. Now it is time for people to know my art. The album is coming and now I’m still deciding on the title,” she said. Afrikka said she has a message to empower all the women in as far as love and relationships are concerned. “I have a lot to tell other women, empower them from personal experiences. We will have a Dzepfunde Tour where we will be performing in universities. My music is clean, I thrive on clean lyrics something which is family friendly,” she said. Her wish now is to have a collaboration with musicians such as Winky D or Selmor Mtukudzi. “If Tuku was alive, I would have loved to work with him. Now I can say Winky D or Selmor. I love the way they do their music.”
