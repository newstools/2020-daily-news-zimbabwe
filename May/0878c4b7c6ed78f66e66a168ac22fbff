tafirenyikam@dailynews.co.zw THE government says it needs a whopping $21 billion to ensure the safe re-opening of schools, in the wake of the havoc that has been caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the Daily News reports. This comes as authorities are planning to re-open schools at the end of June, under a cautious five-phase programme. It also comes as the government is at war with teachers who have vowed to stay away from work unless they are given adequate personal protective equipment (PPEs). Appearing before the parliamentary portfolio committee on Primary and Secondary Education yesterday, the permanent secretary in the ministry — Thumisang Thabela — said the $21 billion would ensure a safe return to schools by learners. Thabela revealed that the government would seek the help of partners, including United Nations (UN) agencies, to fund the re-opening. Some of the requirements the government must make available for schools to be fully equipped for learning include the provision of clean water at every school. “We also need to have liquid hand-washing detergents, hand-washing stations, sanitisers, especially for urbanites, masks for the 4,5 million learners and over 290 000 staff. “Gloves for the management of suspected cases of Covid-19 at the schools, two gowns for health co-ordinators at each school, disinfectants for schools, adequate and clean toilets, as well as tents to use as classes since some of the schools are being used as quarantine centres,” Thabela also said. She added that her ministry had also requested permission from the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); Welfare to recruit 6 000 more teachers on top of the 2 300 they had already been allowed to recruit next month, to cater for the deficit that would be created when classes are split to ensure social distancing.
