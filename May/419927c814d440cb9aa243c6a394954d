ZimThrive was established to bring Zimbabweans who live in various countries around the world together, encouraging them to gather in Zimbabwe at the same time with the aim of reinforcing unity, building new and old friendships, and creating a stronger and self-sufficient nation. Its month-long entertainment initiative meant for April was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Running under the theme “Homecoming” key events were pencilled for Harare, Bulawayo, Victoria Falls, Chimanimani, Nyanga and Kariba. ZimThrive co-founder Mike Tashaya said: “We all know how good giving or receiving kindness makes us feel. That’s why it’s our focus for this year.” He added that hopefully people can follow them throughout the week across all their online platforms for various activities. Tashaya said people can help in any way possible to show kindness to the people around them in this season. “As we wish everyone a happy Mental Health Week it is important for everyone to keep in mind that this year’s theme is ‘Kindness’.” He said kindness is defined by doing something towards yourself and others, motivated by the genuine desire to make a positive difference.
