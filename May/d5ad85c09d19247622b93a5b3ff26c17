Jeffrey Muvundusi in BULAWAYO TWO Bulawayo-based rappers Wilson Matarutso aka Criss Swiss and Blessings Bejile aka The Dot have released a joint album titled Room 328. The album is a breath of fresh air from two talented rappers who are reuniting after a long time, having worked together under their pioneer group then called the Fat Boys. This new seven-track album whose song Bad Vibe topped radio charts on ZiFM last week features a host of artistes who include Lee Mchoney, Vicjita, Muse, Uno xo, Real Shona and Czar Odriego. “However, having come together to produce this album, we are happy with the response that it has received so far, especially the track Bad Vibes which has been rocking the airwaves lately,” he said. Due to the advent of coronavirus, the duo has been marketing their album online. “The response has been positive so far, people are really following our tunes on various platforms like iTunes and YouTube, among others. We have however, set aside our plans to shoot a video for the album due to the pandemic.”
