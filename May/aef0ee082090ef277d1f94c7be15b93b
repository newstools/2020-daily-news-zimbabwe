masakadzab@dailynews.co.zw LAWYER and sungura musician Panganayi Hare has added his voice to gender-based violence triggered by the current economic challenges, urging men to desist from inflicting pain on women. In a song titled Chibhakera, the singer, also known as Mukoma Panga, highlights some of the causes leading to clashes in the home; among them shortage of basic commodities. The song comes at a time when there is an increase in gender-based violence during the lockdown period, which was introduced as a measure to contain the spread of coronavirus. “We have heard that cases of domestic violence have drastically increased during this lockdown period, more so given the biting economic challenges. In the song Chibhakera we are saying whatever hardships we face we must always desist from domestic violence and give dialogue a chance. Domestic violence, whether perpetrated by a man or woman, is wrong. This is what the song Chibhakera is about,” Hare said. The song is off his forthcoming album Pfimbi Yegudo which could have been released by now had it not been for the lockdown, which has put entertainment events on hold.
This will be Hare’s second album after the success of his debut Mbuva Yehwiza. “The album is ready for release. However, we want our fans to enjoy this single and once the lockdown is over we will release the album and have a proper launch,” he said. Hare also highlights socio-economic challenges that the country is facing; the rise in cost of living as basic necessities such as health care, clothing and food have risen beyond the reach of many. “Chibhakera is addressing the socio-economic issues we are all facing at the moment and which issues we will still face even without Covid-19. So that’s why I thought this is the right time to release the song. Now that we have this indefinite lockdown all for our good we say no to any form of domestic violence,” he added.
