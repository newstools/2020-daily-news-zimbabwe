HIGH-RIDING singer Mukudzei Mukombe aka Jah Prayzah has broken silence about his comparison to dancehall music star Winky D saying the two’s music is totally different. The singer added that he cannot stop people from talking or drawing comparisons between the two music stars.
This comes as the two have found themselves subject to comparison, with a divided audience while others have maintained neutrality. “I believe our music is different and that there is no competition between us. When I got into the music industry, I never focused on competing with anyone and up to now I do not compete. However, people talk and it excites them to have such comparisons,” he said. The two are arguably among the country’s top five singers.
Jah Prayzah who recently dropped his 10th album Hokoyo said focus is on his work and he will not let the talk get to his head. “We have reached a stage where people cannot talk about one of us without mentioning the other. However, we cannot let that get into our heads otherwise we will lose focus.”
When Jah Prayzah dropped his new video Mkwasha which is on the new album, comparisons were quick to be made that it had broken the record previously held by Winky D’s MuGarden. Debate is always up as to who is “bigger” than the other and consensus is never reached.
