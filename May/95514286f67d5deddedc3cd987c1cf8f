ZIMBABWE Cricket (ZC) are looking forward to fulfilling the three-match ODI series against Australia as per the Future Tours Programme (FTP) if international cricket is allowed to return during the coronavirus pandemic. The Baggy Greens confirmed their return to international cricket will be heralded by three ODIs against the Chevrons set for August 9, 12 and 15 Down Under. “While acknowledging the difficulty in navigating a global pandemic, we are nonetheless encouraged by the progress Australia is making in combatting the coronavirus and the positive impact that it is having on our ability to host an exciting summer of cricket in 2020-21,” Cricket Australia chief executive Kevin Roberts said in a statement last Friday. On the local front sources confirmed efforts to resuscitate the game are at an advanced stage guided by the government’s policy and the ICC guidelines. “The players are looking forward to the tour. It’s been long since they toured Australia and played in those conditions,” the source confirmed. “However, it is the practicality of that tour happening that remains veiled in obscurity due to coronavirus because it is scheduled for August and now we are in June the host country is also still under lockdown so they are lot of issues that need to be done before the tour becomes a reality.”
