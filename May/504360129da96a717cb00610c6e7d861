sibandat@dailynews.co.zw HIP-Hop musician Nigel Panaishe Chifamba aka Treville Escobar has dispelled rumours that he is into selling drugs through a new video titled Escobar released on YouTube. The Chitungwiza-based rapper who is also an environment engineering student at the Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) focuses mainly on hip-hop poetic rap, storytelling, hard-core and gangsta rap. In an interview with the Daily News Treville Escobar said the title of the track was simply inspired by his rap nickname which is Escobar. “Through this video I will be addressing the issue of why I named myself Escobar.” He said he has decided to use this video to correct people who think that he sells drugs because of the name Escobar. “People in my area actually think I sell drugs because most people who call themselves Escobars tend to sell drugs but I don’t, I just sell tracks on digital online platforms like iTunes, Denzer, and Spotify,” he said. Treville Escobar added that the idea of naming himself Escobar comes from trying to tell people that instead of pushing drugs he is master in selling tracks on digital online platforms. He said he is not like the famous Pablo Escobar who is well known for selling drugs back in days, but he is more like ‘‘Nas’’ Escobar who is an American rapper. He said while he has had many lined up shows at his school, they were cancelled due to the pandemic. “I was even supposed to open up for Winky D but unfortunately this pandemic happened.”
