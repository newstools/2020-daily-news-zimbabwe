chikwaris@dailynews.co.zw BULAWAYO-BASED gospel musician-cum-cleric Tapiwanashe Jefta Marambi, 35, has released a single giving hope and urging fellow citizens not to despair amid the ravaging coronavirus pandemic. Titled Munesu/Ulathi, the single which was done in isiNdebele, Shona as well as English vividly captures the dire situation facing ordinary people as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, while sharing hope through fostering unity and love. The track is rapidly gaining traction on the airwaves, cementing the budding musicianâ€™s foothold as a recording artiste in the cutthroat gospel music genre. It was produced by Brighton Chirumbwana at Play On Studios in the City of Kings, as Bulawayo is affectionately called. The Munesu/Ulathi singer leads the Marambi Music Band which consists of Hold Muchenu, Brighton Chirumbwana, Memory Ephraim and Rumbidzai Tasara. The group released their debut album last year titled Kuna Mwari Zvitaure with five tracks namely; Chokwadi zita raJesu, Dai vasiri Jesu, Kuna Mwari zvitaure (title track), Ngikhokele OJehovah and Tichengetei. The album remains popular with gospel lovers on local radio stations. Marambi, who hails from Buhera, ministers with the Methodist Church in Zimbabwe Mzilikazi-Luveve circuit. He is also passionate about charity work and is involved in philanthropic work through the Methodist Caring Hand (MethoCare). He is married to Nomaqhawe Ncube and the couple is blessed with two children.
