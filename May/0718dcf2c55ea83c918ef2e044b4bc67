ZIMBABWE international Marshall Munetsi has extended his contract with French Ligue 1 side Stade de Reims until 2024 putting paid to anxiety about his post Covid-19 future. He becomes the second player to extend his contract with the club after 22-year-old Guinea-Bissau midfielder Moreto Cassama who extended his last week. The 23-year-old defensive midfielder signed for Reims from Orlando Pirates in July and has featured in 21 games for his new side. Reims sat on number five on the log table with 41 points from 28 games winning 10, drawing 11 and losing seven times before the global pandemic Covid-19 put a halt to the league. The Zimbabwean was a heartbroken man last month following the death of Reims team doctor Bernard Gonzalez who committed suicide while in isolation after the 60-year-old tested positive of coronavirus. Gonzalez led a team of medical officials that conducted medicals on Munetsi before completing his move to Reims.
“Such a great person and always full of kind words,” Munetsi said of Gonzalez.
