sibandat@dailynews.co.zw SOUTH African gospel singer Sipho Makhabane will on Sunday feature as guest of honour during a gospel music online programme aimed at keeping the genre alive in this lockdown period. The programme will consist of live interviews with musicians sharing their gospel music industry experiences.
Makhabane will be accompanied by Lawrence Haisa and upcoming gospel musician Munashe Matambo. The show organiser Timothy Ngwenya said: “There will also be music from different gospel singers being shared and the guests will also be responding to questions from the viewers.” Ngwenya said the programme will mainly feature two legends Makhabane and Haisa together with an upcoming musician in the industry who will discuss issues concerning growth and the future of the genre in Africa. He said this would be a great opportunity for gospel music lovers across the board to ask their burning questions and also learn more in line with the growth of the musical genre. “Due to the Covid-19 pandemic there has been a huge loss of income to the musicians who had live shows lined up that had to be cancelled.” He added that, nevertheless, being grounded also brought an opportunity for gospel musicians to reflect on their careers and how best they can improve themselves to fit modern day standards. Ngwenya said it has also allowed them to interact more with their fans especially on the social media platforms and this is very important because the world is going digital. “We have previously hosted a music competition with 16 musicians and three of them came up as winners and this time we are having the top five take up a challenge and win a video shoot contract; therefore we are excited musicians all over are getting involved.”
