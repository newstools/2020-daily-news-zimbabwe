CRESTA Hotels will reopen two of its five Zimbabwean properties on Monday, all five having been closed since the start of the national lockdown. Cresta Hotels’ group managing director in Zimbabwe Chipo Mandela said the two hotels resuming operations will be Cresta Oasis Hotel and Apartments in Harare and Cresta Churchill Hotel in Bulawayo. She added that all staff will be tested by the CareNet Health Facility before going back to work, all bedrooms and public areas will be thoroughly and regularly disinfected and sanitised and a doctor will be on call for any guest or member of staff concerned about a health situation. Staff who have been tested and resume duties will be accommodated in the hotel to avoid risk through the use of public transport. Mandela said Cresta Hotels remain committed to adhering to stringent policies and educating our guests on best practices. Our main objective is to ensure the safety of our staff and guests while delivering service with a smile. “We thank all customers, staff and other stakeholders for their continued support and look forward to welcoming them at Cresta Churchill and Cresta Oasis.”
