DAIRIBORD Zimbabwe has reaffirmed their support for the grassroot development of rugby by extending their sponsorship with Prince Edward for the country’s Premier Schools Rugby Festival. The initial sponsorship was coming to an end this year after inking a three-year deal worth $182 000 per year which was however, periodically reviewed due to the hyperinflationary environment and will run for the next three years with a clear possibility of renewal. Dairibord marketing director Tracey Mutaviri said their involvement in developmental rugby is to bridge the gap and gulf in class. “Participants will also enjoy Dairibord’s product range which includes dairy products (milk, ice cream, yoghurt) ; Ready to drink beverages, cordials, tea, drinking chocolate, peanut butter, mayonnaise, salad cream, tomato sauce, mineral water. Last year the organisers staged a memorable 2019 tournament that attracted over 100 schools including 16 from primary who showcased their prowess on the field of play at a tender age, this year’s edition promised to be bigger and better. However, the event had to be postponed indefinitely due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown. “The interest among local rugby fans has also been growing in leaps and bounds. Rugby, being a high contact sport and in light of the coronavirus, Prince Edward School, Dairibord, have seen it only fit and responsible to defer the Seventh Edition of the Dairibord Schools Rugby Festival as a health risk mitigating measure for the participating teams, officials and fans,” the Festival organising committee said. “The health and safety of all the Dairibord Schools Rugby Festival participants is of utmost importance to us, hence the decision to defer to a future date to be advised in line with the developments regarding the Covid-19 pandemic.”
