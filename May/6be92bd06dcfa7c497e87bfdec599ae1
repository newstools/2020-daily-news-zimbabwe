As Africa Month comes to a close, MultiChoice Zimbabwe is hosting a ‘‘watch party’’ so that Zimbabweans can enjoy a selection of the varied music of Africa in their own homes. The Celebrate Africa Watch Party will be broadcast on Facebook from 3pm to 4pm on May 30 (today), hosted on the DStvZimbabwe page by MultiChoice Zimbabwe. “Popular DJ Smith will bring the music to viewers and award-winning choreographer and dancer John Cole will add some slick moves to the fun event,” said Liz Dziva, publicity and public relations manager of MultiChoice Zimbabwe. The pair will be based at The Venue, a leading banqueting and events centre in Avondale, Harare. The Venue will provide a prize of a dinner for two for a lucky viewer, while MultiChoice adds to the excitement with a prize of a brand new decoder. “It’s all about music, dance, home entertainment and fun, all centred round the fascinating and vibrant music of Africa,” said Dziva. “And even more fun, it is open to everyone and we look forward to the sharing of images of people celebrating the music in their homes as we move through an exciting hour of joy.”
