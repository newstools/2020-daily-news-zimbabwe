Tinashe Sibanda Lifestyle Writer sibandat@dailynews.co.zw As a way of celebrating the ongoing Culture Week, the National Gallery of Zimbabwe (NGZ)’s Education Department is hosting the Art Adventures in which professional artists conduct lessons for school children. This year’s Culture Week is running under the theme: “Zimbabwe @ 40, celebrating our cultural diversity and heritage.” NGZ deputy director and chief curator Raphael Chikukwa said a number of activities that celebrate Zimbabwe’s rich diverse cultures and promotion of cultural activities have been organised by the gallery; these will also be platforms to engage audiences during this lockdown period. He said the class will be available on Zoom and YouTube, with a strong “Cultures of Zimbabwe” theme that is rooted in the gallery’s Culture Box exercise. Culture Week was established to promote cultural diversity by showing different types of expression, and is centred on the International Day of Cultural Diversity, which was set for May 21 annually. He commended the statement made at the launch of Culture Week by Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation minister Kirsty Coventry who urged Zimbabweans to keep their spirits up and to keep culture in their hearts while practising Ubuntu/ Hunhu, regardless of the current physical distancing measures and the gallery, as such, aims to stay connected with the public from the comfort of their homes. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); }); Another engagement will take place when Harare Conversations discusses museums in the cultural matrix. Discussants include Charles Bhebhe, Ivan Murambiwa and Candice Alison, among others. This will lead up to an exchange between Zeitz MOCAA (RSA) and the gallery in their series of Head to Head Conversations, on Africa Day.
