WHILE the coronavirus (Covid-19) crisis has created an unprecedented burden on the travel and tourism sector, all action to restore open trading conditions should be taken as soon as it is feasible to do so, whether in stages or in whole, a hospitality executive has said. Tourism Business Council of Zimbabwe (TBCZ) president Winnie Muchanyuka said while the tourism sector has shut down almost all activity, travel and tourism operators have been active in supporting initiatives related to the fight against Covid-19 and will continue to do so. She said the TBCZ is fully aware of the exceptional level of crisis facing travel and tourism, and hopes that within the framework of health re-establishment, the means to restore operation can be provided as speedily and positively as possible. TBCZ also recommends a plan of action to create a travel bubble within the southern African community of nations, allowing for regional travel between what may be described as low-impact countries in terms of the spread of Covid-19. “International tourism will depend on the revival of international travel and tourism and we in Zimbabwe must be at the forefront of seizing opportunities that stem from an opening up of such travel. “At this point the TBCZ is a willing and capable partner in this entire process and we look forward to playing a role in moving the sector forward in the national interest. We look forward to urgent interaction with the ministry, with the ZTA, with operators and with all relevant organisations within the sector and outside it.” Muchanyuka said the TBCZ reminds all travel and tourism operators to update the TBCZ secretariat with information on the status of their operations so that this can be shared as widely as possible. “The future may or may not be a return to the ‘normal’ we knew before and there may be a ‘new normal’ which we must identify and create, but in any event the ingenuity, resourcefulness, innovation, team spirit and dedication of travel and tourism operators and administrator will be the foundation of that future.”
