matarutseg@dailynews.co.zw DYNAMOS legend Memory Mucherahohwa, pictured, yesterday waded into politics as he added his voice to the leadership wrangle in the MDC, backing the embattled Nelson Chamisa over his rival Thokozani Khupe. While Mucherahohwa said he is not actively involved in politics, the former Glamour Boys skipper said he felt inclined to give his views on what is happening in the country’s biggest opposition political party. This comes after the Supreme Court upheld a 2019 High Court ruling which confirmed Khupe as the legitimate interim leader of the party. In the judgment handed down by Supreme Court judges Paddington Garwe, Bharat Patel and Antoinette Guvava, Chamisa’s elevation to the MDC’s presidency was declared unconstitutional. The ruling paved the way for former number two to the late MDC president Morgan Tsvangirai, Khupe to act as the party’s interim leader, while preparing for an extraordinary congress that will choose a new leader.
Mucherahohwa took to micro blogging site Twitter to make his voice heard. “Memory Mucherahohwa supports MDC and with Advocate Nelson Chamisa as our President, Thank you,” he tweeted. And speaking to the Daily News following his tweet, Mucherahohwa explained that he was only exercising his democratic right as enshrined in the country’s Constitution. “I can’t say I’m actively involved in politics. It’s just that sometimes politics ends up coming to you,” reckons Mucherahohwa. “The MDC must sit down and find each other. Not only MDC but Zanu PF too. These people must unite for the right cause. “We want people to be happy. Nothing is moving in the country and it’s very worrisome. Things are just not okay in our country,” he said. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });
