HARARE – Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) hopes to take the women’s game to the next level after naming former national team players in their inaugural selection panel for the Lady Chevrons. Former Zimbabwe skipper Julia Chibhabha is the convenor of the selection committee which also features renowned batter Thando Mlilo and all-rounder Emely Njinjika. Since the team was established, the national team coach was solely responsible for selecting the squad. ZC managing director Givemore Makoni said women cricket has grown from a lone-town discipline to a national sport hence the need to put in place the necessary structures to help it grow further. “Women cricket is a team and a squad of its own. It is an acknowledgement of the fact that the game has grown in leaps and bounds,” Makoni told the Daily News yesterday. “When we started it was just a small group from Harare and players drawn mainly from Highfield but now it is played in every province across the country. “Therefore it is imperative that we put a professional setup and structures that shows the seriousness exhibited by the players both past and present which is the reason why we came up with the women selection panel for women by women.” Makoni said the three players named on the maiden women panel have what it takes to represent the interests of women and their experience of playing at the highest level of the game is just what the doctor ordered.
