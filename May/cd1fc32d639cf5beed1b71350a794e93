A NEW live music streaming platform called BeApp has teamed up with Coca-Cola to launch Coke Studio Sessions, an exclusive collaboration featuring a diverse line-up of musical performances for fans to enjoy over 60 consecutive days. Live performances from more than 100 artistes across the globe, including Katy Perry, Anitta, DJ Khaled, Bebe Rexha, Miguel, Cast of Hamilton and Steve Aoki have started to refresh fans one virtual performance at a time and support the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. The Coke Studio Sessions mark the official debut of BeApp, the social live music streaming platform from tech industry veterans Ray Smith and Ross Mason. It is an immersive, digital destination for fans to enjoy live music in a new way where unlike other virtual concert platforms; BeApp will offer a variety of interactive features. These features include In-app sharing, currency/points, prizes and upgrades, front row seats offering fans a greater digital presence during the live stream, including having the user’s photo and name visible to all viewers and also a platform where fans will have the ability to make a donation to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to support Covid-19 relief efforts. “BeApp was designed for digital connection through a shared love of live music, and people need that connection now more than ever,” said BeApp founder Ray Smith. He added that they are thrilled to have Coca-Cola as their exclusive launch partner as they introduce BeApp to fans around the world through unique new experiences. The first weekend of streaming included performances from Diplo, Kaskade and DJ Khaled among others. Additional artists will be announced across Coca-Cola and BeApp social channels. Throughout the 60-day programme, fans will have the opportunity to contribute directly to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to support Covid-19 efforts.
