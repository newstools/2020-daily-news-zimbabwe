Culture Week, which is commemorated yearly celebrates cultural diversity in the country and was launched on Monday by Arts minister Kirsty Coventry who urged the nation to embrace the digital way of doing things. This year’s Culture Week got international recognition with Google Doodle paying homage to Zimbabwe’s national instrument, the mbira, on Thursday. A Google Doodle is a special, temporary alteration of the logo on Google’s home pages intended to commemorate holidays, events, achievements, and notable historical figures and on Wednesday it was all about the mbira. As part of Culture Week activities, the nation this week joined other nations in celebrating Museums Day. Over the years, Culture Week is celebrated by various arts gatherings in different provinces but this year much of the celebrations were done online as the country is on lockdown as a measure to curb the spread of Covid-19.
