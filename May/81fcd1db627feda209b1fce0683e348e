PRETORIA – Highlands Park have officially parted ways with Zimbabwean striker Tendai Ndoro. The Tembisa-based club confirmed the news of Ndoro’s departure yesterday morning without disclosing the reason behind his axing. According to the Lions of the North, Ndoro had a meeting with the management on Tuesday and that’s when both parties decided to go separate ways. “Highlands Park confirms the amicable parting of ways with Tendai Ndoro following a meeting between both parties late on Tuesday,” reads the statement. “The club wishes him well and is thankful for his contribution in the team as well as the professionalism displayed during his time with us.” Indications were there that Ndoro would leave at the end of the season after struggling to cement his place in Owen Da Gama’s starting line-up this season. He arrived highly-rated by the management following his impressive record at both Mpumalanga Black Aces and Orlando Pirates. However, the technical team felt he didn’t do enough after scoring just twice in 14 matches for the Lions of the North. Ndoro featured just once in Highlands Park’s last 12 league games — and that alone raised eyebrows that he may no longer be in the coach’s plans for the future. – Goal.com
