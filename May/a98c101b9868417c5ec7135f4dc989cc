TALENTED music producer Rodney Sibanda’s profile continues to rise after he produced six songs off Jah Prayzah’s latest album Hokoyo. Known in music circles as Rodney Beatz, his rise to fame can be traced back to the days of Kuwadzana’s Sunshine Studio working with producers Sheltung and Tynash before having a stint at Mbare’s Chillspot Recordz. “I never knew that one day I would be able to produce for a musician like Jah Prayzah. It has been a long journey emanating from Sunshine Studios with Boss Werras who brought me to the capital from Marondera,” he said. On Jah Prayzah’s album he produced the title track Hokoyo, Kana Ndada which featured Zahara, Miteuro which featured Zimpraise, Munyaradzi, Donhodzo and combined with Dj Tamuka on Dzirere. It is exciing that Rodney Beatz has managed to evolve from being a mere Zimdancehall music producer to a complete creator working with singers such as Freeman, Cindy Tamy Moyo, Nutty O and Fusion 5. He is the man behind popular Zimdancehall riddims; Sunshine and the Werras Journey and worked on albums such as Freeman’s New Chapter and Cindy’s Setter Pace. “I have learnt not to focus on one genre, now I can do a lot from dancehall, Afro pop up to sungura,” he said.
He said the lockdown has hampered the release of much of the work he has done. “There are more fireworks coming. Right now we are talking of Jah Prayzah’s music; there is more coming from the likes of Tamy. We have not been fully working because of the lockdown but I hope this will be passing.”
