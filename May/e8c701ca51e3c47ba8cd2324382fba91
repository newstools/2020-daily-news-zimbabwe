Blessing Masakadza LIFESTYLE WRITER masakadzab@dailynews.co.zw  A group of singers from the resort town of Victoria Falls will on Saturday converge for an online musical session aimed at reminding people of the city’s touristic attractions. The brain child of Paul Shambare of Express Entertainment, the concert will bring together Muffia King, Jah Mercy, Terra Firm and Kidlee among others as they seek to market the resort town. While concerns had been raised that online concerts were only covering Harare singers, this is also an example of out of capital city online events. “This is an event to remind people of Victoria Falls. This is a prime resort town with one of the world’s seven wonders. “Currently we are in a lockdown and there is no activity and we are coming in to remind people not to forget this destination. Express Promotions has in the past contributed to the town’s night life with several events, hosting several musicians among them Suluman Chimbetu, Killer T, Hwindi Prezident and the Chillspot family. “We have had several big names and we will continue bringing them but this goal is for local chanters.” googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1588599181508-1'); });
