Nox shared a video with Master KG in studio sampling the song My Melody. “Work mode activated. We have something up our sleeve and Africa get ready. My brother Master KG and sister Nomcebo thank you. Super excited about this journey we have started together,” Nox captioned his photo with the two. His local management told the Daily News that much is coming from the singer and that the song with Master KG is something to look forward to. Master KG, born Kgaogelo Moagi is a South African musician and record producer known for the hit Skeleton Move.
Nox has been doing well with some of his songs such as Handichada being played on regional channels such as Channel O. “We have rebranded and I’m glad you are loving the new Nox, we also appreciate the corporate support coming our way now,” he said.
