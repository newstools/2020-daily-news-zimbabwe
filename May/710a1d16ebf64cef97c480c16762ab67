THE Sports and Recreation Commission yesterday allowed a number of minority disciplines to resume their activities but football remains under lockdown. With the coronavirus (Covid-19) still a major threat and the government’s lockdown measures still in place since March 30, there is no quick return for the beautiful game. Other sporting disciplines that have been classified as high risk due to their contact nature include volleyball, field hockey basketball, wrestling, water polo, taekwondo, judo and handball. The medium risk sports that have been given the greenlight to resume activities are badminton, lawn bowls, soft ball, weightlifting, gymnastics, goal ball and rabble tennis They will join those in the low risk group that includes tennis, archery, pool, swimming, athletics, rowing, cycling, equestrian, fencing, golf, polo, motor sport and BMX, shooting, chess, darts and drafts. “It is against this background that your sport code was categorised as medium risk thus implying that activities may resume but you must in the first instance send to SRC specific measures that your clubs will put in place for consideration by relevant and responsible national authorities.” Among a host of preventative measures being asked to adhere to is temperature checks and sanitisers at the premises entrance, wearing of face masks and gloves by the staff, coaches and athletes off the field of play.
