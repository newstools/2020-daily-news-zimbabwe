HIGHLANDERS are not short of suitors with former West Ham coach Hassan Oktay making himself available for the vacant post following Mark Harrison’s departure last week. Harrison returned to his native England last Saturday following a mutual agreement with the Bosso executive to suspend his contract due to the uncertainty brought about by the coronavirus (Covid-19). The 2020 Castle Lager Premiership season should have commenced in March but the spread of the novel virus has resulted in all public events suspended indefinitely. Last week, the Sports ministry and the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) outlined how they intended to resume sporting activities across the country starting with the low risk disciplines.
Unfortunately for football, the beautiful game was placed in the high risk category due to its contact nature and the large crowds that follow it. High risk sporting disciplines will have to wait longer before they are permitted to resume.
With no early start date on the horizon, Bosso and Harrison decided to part ways mutually.
However, it is not clear whether the Briton will return to his post once the virus has cleared and football is given the green light to continue. Oktay, who was a coach at the West Ham Academy, has publicly declared his desire to fill the vacancy at Bosso.
The Turkish national was in charge of Gor Mahia in Kenya last year and led the side to the league title and the quarter-finals of the African Confederation Cup. “My representatives have told me Highlanders could be interested in my services. I would be interested too, the 46-year-old said. “Zimbabwe has so much football talent. I would wish to develop some of that. I would also want to win the league with Highlanders the way we did it at Gor Mahia.”
