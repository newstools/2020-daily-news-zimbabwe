Tinashe SibandaLifestyle Writersibandat@dailynews.co.zwFollowing the release of his recent track title Usamira, the Shurugwi born star said he has several more singles lined up as he is finding his way in terms of how best to ensure that his audience is aware of his releases.Usamira was officially made available online on May 15 and the track is an inspirational song about life in general.In an interview with the Daily News Decibel said: “When the chips are down you don’t quit. You do not allow negative vibes or people to weigh you down.”He said through the song he wants people to know that life is a marathon, not a sprint.Just the same as everything else he writes, he is a social commentator who writes about issues that he sees around him.“Logistically it is not straight forward with me being out of the country but we are getting there. Expect at least a single every month until we feel that our delivery has reached optimal efficiency,” he said.His recent releases include One Shot, Kutenda, Uchi, Mubvunzo and now Usamira which are available on all reputable streaming platforms.The musician said he has plans to come back to Zimbabwe to perform in the near future as home is always close to his heart. “For me as a musician nothing has changed much as my music revenue is more from sales and live streams and these have not been affected by the on-going Covid-19 global pandemic.”Decibel hit the limelight after his single, Nakai, topped radio charts for a straight two weeks after release. He then left the country at the peak of his music career in 2005. His second single, Chido was equally good as both songs occupied positions two and five on the year 2002’s Top 100.After the video for Chido stayed on number one on the charts for more than six weeks Decibel then released his first album, What Kind of World, in 2004 and it became the best-selling album under the Country Boy Records stable.UNITED Kingdom-based musician Daniel “Decibel” Mazhindu says he will be releasing single records as he is not yet ready to give people a complete album.
